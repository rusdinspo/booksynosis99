<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://ebukpdfmobikindele.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>Great Ghost Stories (Books of Wonder)</h2><p><p><em>"I can assure you," said the young man, "that it will take a very tangible ghost to frighten me."</em></p><p>So says the foolishly brave narrator of H. G. Wells's "The Red Room," one of the thirteen great ghost stories gathered together in this deluxe illustrated volume. Selected and illustrated by Barry Moser, a master of the macabre, these spooky tales will send a shiver down the spine of even the bravest reader.</p><p>This new edition includes classic masterpieces of horror by H. P. Lovecraft, Brain Stoker, Richard Middleton, and Arthur Conan Doyle. There are also several chilling modern tales of the supernatural by such authors as Madeleine L'Engle and Joyce Carol Oates to petrify even the most seasoned explorer of the dark realms.</p><p>From the slowly gathering dread of being caught in the grips of a haunted house to the sure, sharp horror of realization that overcomes one entering the spirit world, nothing compares to the thrill of these tales from the great beyond. With Barry Moser's fourteen eerie watercolors, this collection is sure to satisfy readers with an insatiable taste for terror, as well as those who simply love the chill down the spine that comes from reading a great ghost </p>story.</p><p><p>HarperCollins Publishers is a proud supporter of First Book, a national nonprofit organization whose mission is to give children from low-income families the opportunity to read and own their own new books. The primary goal of First Book is to work with existing literacy programs to distribute new books to children who, for economic reasons, have little or no access to books. In this way, First Book effectively leverages the heroic efforts of local tutoring, mentoring, and family literacy organizations as they work to reach children who need help the most. First Book distributes millions of books to hundreds of thousands of children nationwide each year.

He is widely celebrated for his dramatic wood engravings for the only twentieth-century edition of the entire King James Bible illustrated by a single artist. He lives in western Massachusetts.</p>Grade 6 Up-These 13 stories are written by such well-known authors as H. G. Wells, Bram Stoker, and Madeleine L'Engle. The selections range from psychological thrillers such as H. P. Lovecraft's "The Music of Erich Zann," in which a musician must play in order to keep an unspeakable evil at bay, to stories with surprise endings, like that of W. W. Jacobs's "The Monkey's Paw," in which the characters discover that it's not always good to have wishes come true. Averaging 15 pages in length, each tale is accompanied by a full-page, full-color illustration. While these impressive watercolors may make the collection more appealing to readers, most of the stories, with the exception of Moser's retelling of "Polly Vaughn," Philippa Pearce's "Samantha and the Ghost," and James Haskins's version of "Dead Aaron," can easily be found in other collections.<br><i>Michele Snyder, Chappaqua Public Library, NY</i><br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Collector&#39;s Guide to Shawnee Pottery</h2><p>Briefly traces the history of the Shawnee Pottery Company, shows a variety of cookie jars, pitchers, creamers, shakers, teapots, and dinnerware, and lists current values</p><p></p><h2>Slovak-English/English-Slovak Concise Dictionary (Hippocrene Concise Dictionary)</h2><p>This dictionary includes a phonetic guide to pronunciation in both English and Slovak.

Focusing on abused or neglected children, the AIDS-afflicted, the elderly, women, African-Americans, refugees, and prisoners on death row, Father Walter Burghardt urges that we become sensitive to their problems and faithful to the responsibilities we have undertaken in our covenant with God. We must hear the cries of the poor, he says, because social doctrine should evolve in large measure from the needs of people who share more of Jesus&#39; crucifixion than his resurrection.</p><p>Burghardt's work is an expanded version of the 1994 Lyman Beecher Lectures on Preaching, which Burghardt originally delivered at the Yale Divinity School. As he explains in his preface, the lectures were shaped by an intersection of autobiography with history. He attributes their general subject--the Christian pulpit and the just word--to "recent preoccupations," but his passion for the preaching of justice is hardly a recent development. The lectureship has been identified from its inception with prominent preachers, many of whom have also been noted as theorists of preaching; Burghardt continues that tradition. The book is a mixture of homiletic theory and practice, as valuable for the window it provides on Burghardt's theological and pastoral development as for the particular positions it develops. It is also important for the insight it provides into the twentieth-century transformation of the Roman Catholic Church--a glimpse through the eyes of a generally progressive theologian and pastor shaped by a generally conservative institution. <i>Steve Schroeder</i></p><h2>The Psychology of Language: From Data to Theory</h2><p><p>Now in full colour, this fully revised edition of the best-selling textbook provides an up-to-date and comprehensive introduction to the psychology of language for undergraduates, postgraduates, and researchers.

Hesiod is believed to have lived between 750 and 650 B.C., and along with Homer it was Hesiod&#x2019;s work that was the oldest to survive in Ancient Greece.</b> It is still unclear which one of the two great poets came before the other, a source of debate among scholars even during antiquity. Hesiod's writings are one of the oldest and most important sources on topics like Greek mythology, farming, economic thought, astronomy, and timekeeping. <br>Among the works credited to Hesiod is <i>The Shield of Heracles</i>, an archaic Greek epic poem consisting of 480 hexameter verses. The poem is about one of the journeys of Heracles, better known in English as Hercules. <i>Theogony </i>is an epic poem that discusses the beginning of the world, gods like Chaos, Gaia, and Eros, and the genealogy of the gods. Hesiod's work took all of the different mythologies spread among different regions of Greece and turned them into one national narrative for the entire nation.</p><p></p><h2>Theories Of Counseling And Psychotherapy: Systems, Strategies, And Skills</h2><p>For courses in Counseling Theories and Techniques.

For this provocative rephotography project, bringing past and present into dynamic juxtaposition, renowned photographer Mark Klett has gone to the same locations pictured in forty-five compelling historic photographs taken in the days following the 1906 earthquake and fires and precisely duplicated each photograph&#x2019;s vantage point. The result is an elegant and powerful comparison that challenges our preconceptions about time, history, and culture. &#x201c;I think the pictures ask us to become aware of the extraordinary qualities of our own distinct moment in time. But it is a realization that a particular future is not guaranteed by the flow of time in any given direction.&#x201d; So says Mark Klett discussing this multilayered project in an illuminating interview included in this lavishly produced volume, which accompanies an exhibition at The Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco. <br><br><i>After the Ruins, 1906 and 2006 </i> features a vivid essay by noted environmental historian Philip Fradkin on the events surrounding and following the 1906 earthquake, which he describes as &#x201c;the equivalent of an intensive, three-day bombing raid, complete with many tons of dynamite that acted as incendiary devices.&#x201d; A lyrical essay by acclaimed writer Rebecca Solnit considers the meaning of ruins, resurrection, and the evolving geography and history of San Francisco.<br><br><i>Copub: Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco</i></p><p>"<i>After the Ruins</i> is a remarkable achievement. A moving commemoration of a tragic centennial; the residual landscapes of San Francisco that beckon from these words and pictures remind us of history&#x2019;s power and its proximity.

"And yet, in our memory, what character is more alive?" <br>----Widely regarded as the world's first <br>modern novel, Don Quixote chronicles the famous picaresque adventures of the noble knight-errant Don Quixote de La Mancha and his faithful squire, Sancho Panza, as they travel through sixteenth-century Spain. This Modern Library edition presents the acclaimed Samuel Putnam translation of the epic tale, complete with notes, variant readings, and an Introduction by the translator. <br>----The debt owed to Cervantes by literature is immense. From Milan Kundera: "Cervan- <br>tes is the founder of the Modern Era. . . . The novelist need answer to no one but <br>Cervantes." Lionel Trilling observed: "It can be said that all prose fiction is a variation on the theme of Don Quixote." Vladmir Nabo-kov wrote: "Don Quixote is greater today than he was in Cervantes's womb. [He] looms so wonderfully above the skyline of literature, a gaunt giant on a lean nag, that the book lives and will live through [his] sheer vitality. . . . He stands for everything that is gentle, forlorn, pure, unselfish, and gallant. The parody has become a paragon." And V. S. Pritchett observed: "Don Quixote begins as a province, turns into Spain, and ends as a universe. . . . The true spell of Cervantes is that he is a natural magician in pure story-telling." <br> <br> <br>The Modern Library has played a significant role in American cultural life for the better part of a century. The series was founded in 1917 by the publishers Boni and Liveright and eight years later acquired by Bennett Cerf and Donald Klopfer. It provided the foun- <br>dation for their next publishing venture, Random House. The Modern Library has been a staple of the American book trade, providing readers with affordable hardbound editions of important works of literature and thought. For the Modern Library's seventy-fifth anniversary, Random House redesigned the series, restoring as its emblem the running torchbearer created by Lucian Bernhard in 1925 and refurbishing jackets, bindings, and type, as well as inaugurating a new program of selecting titles. The Modern Library continues to provide the world's best books, at the best prices.<p>Edith Grossman's definitive English translation of the Spanish masterpiece. Widely regarded as the world's first modern novel, and one of the funniest and most tragic books ever written, <em>Don Quixote</em> chronicles the famous picaresque adventures of the noble knight-errant Don Quixote of La Mancha and his faithful squire, Sancho Panza, as they travel through sixteenth-century Spain. Unless you read Spanish, you've never read <em>Don Quixote.</em></p><p></p><blockquote>"Though there have been many valuable English translations of <em>Don Quixote,</em> I would commend Edith Grossman's version for the extraordinarily high quality of her prose. The Knight and Sancho are so eloquently rendered by Grossman that the vitality of their characterization is more clearly conveyed than ever before. There is also an astonishing contextualization of Don Quixote and Sancho in Grossman's translation that I believe has not been achieved before. The spiritual atmosphere of a Spain already in steep decline can be felt throughout, thanks to her heightened quality of diction. <p></p><p>Grossman might be called the Glenn Gould of translators, because she, too, articulates every note. Reading her amazing mode of finding equivalents in English for Cervantes's darkening vision is an entrance into a further understanding of why this great book contains within itself all the novels that have followed in its sublime wake."</p><p>From the Introduction by Harold Bloom</p></blockquote><p></p><p>Miguel de Cervantes was born on September 29, 1547, in Alcala de Henares, Spain.

Our understanding of why we behave in certain ways can be greatly enhanced if we take an evolutionary perspective. Understanding the evolutionary pressures that have shaped human behaviour can give us a new insight into why we prefer a good gossip to a lengthy session of algebra, or why children are so good at learning language and so poor at sharing nicely with others. <br><br>Human Evolutionary Psychology offers a comprehensive overview of all aspects of human evolutionary behaviour and psychology. Tackling everything from mate choice to marriage patterns, childcare to cultural evolution, Human Evolutionary Psychology critically assesses the value of evolutionary explanations to humans in both modern western society and traditional pre-industrial societies. The combination of broad scope and in-depth analysis makes it the ideal introduction to this exciting and rapidly expanding area of research.</p><p>"This is more than a much-needed comprehensive introductory text to the area. It is an antidote to the erroneous view that the evolutionary approach to human psychology and action is some monolithic view focused solely upon the concept of adaptation and reproductive success. As this book shows, it is many things, including the study of the causal powers and origins of human culture. If this book has a single message, it is long live pluralism."--Henry Plotkin, University College London <p>"This is an impressive review of the literature on the evolution of human behavior, including human evolutionary ecology and psychology.

Arrested and imprisoned by the Italian Fascist regime in 1926, Gramsci died before fully regaining his freedom. Nevertheless, in his prison notebooks, he recorded thousands of brilliant reflections on an extraordinary range of subjects, establishing an enduring intellectual legacy. <br><br>Columbia University Press's multivolume <i>Prison Notebooks</i> is the only complete critical edition of Antonio Gramsci's seminal writings in English. The notebooks' integral text gives readers direct access not only to Gramsci's influential ideas but also to the intellectual workshop where those ideas were forged. Extensive notes guide readers through Gramsci's extraordinary series of reflections on an encyclopedic range of topics. Volume 3 contains notebooks 6, 7, and 8, in which Gramsci develops his concepts of hegemony, civil society, and the state; reflects extensively on the Renaissance, the Reformation, and Machiavelli's political philosophy; and offers a trenchant critique of the cultural and political practices of fascism. A detailed analysis of positivism and idealism brings Gramsci's philosophy of praxis and conception of historical materialism into sharp relief. Also included are the author's extensive observations on articles and books read during his imprisonment.</p><p>While in prison, Gramsci wrote a series of notebooks covering an extraordinarily wide range of issues; they are his principal achievement. Written without thought of publication, the pages of Gramsci&#39;s notebooks record and reveal this interests in history and historiography, the role of intellectuals in society, political theory, philosophy, Americanism and Fordism, religion, education, cultural analysis, literature, folklore, and linguistics.Antonio Gramsci (1891&#x2013;1937) was an Italian Marxist theorist, one-time leader of the Italian Communist Party, and founder of the official party newspaper, <i>l&#x2019;Unita</i>. Arrested and imprisoned by the Italian Fascist regime in 1926, Gramsci died before fully regaining his freedom. Gramsci&#x2019;s thirty-three prison notebooks, which contain brilliant reflections on a vast range of subjects, are foundational for an array of disciplines and schools of thought.<br><br>Joseph A.

But as necessary as fire is to maintaining healthy ecosystems, it threatens human lives and livelihoods in unacceptable ways. This volume explores the rich yet largely uncharted terrain at the intersection of fire policy, fire science, and fire management in order to find better ways of addressing this pressing dilemma. Written in clear language, it will help scientists, policy makers, and the general public, especially residents of fire-prone areas, better understand where we are today in regard to coping with wildfires, how we got here, and where we need to go. Drawing on abundant historical and analytic information to shed new light on current controversies, <i>Living with Fire </i>offers a dynamic new paradigm for coping with fire that recognizes its critical environmental role. The book also tells how we can rebuild the important ecological and political processes that are necessary for finding better ways to cope with fire and with other complex policy dilemmas.</p><p>"<i>Living with Fire</i> is a breath of fresh air that does an excellent job highlighting the many misconceptions associated with wildland fire. The clarity with which the authors emphasize two key concepts&#x2015;the importance of weather in wildfires and why the 'one-size-fits-all' perspective of fuel modification is counterproductive&#x2015;is enough to make this book required reading for anyone dealing with wildfire."&#x2015;Richard Halsey, author of <i>Fire, Chaparral, and Survival in Southern California</i><br><br>"Jensen and McPherson do an excellent job of explaining common misconceptions about fire, the fundamental basis for failed fire policy, and how incentives for continuing traditional fire prevention approaches underlie many of today's problems. <i>Living with Fire </i>makes the case that a significant overhaul of policy and management approaches will be needed if we are to coexist better with fire."&#x2015;Dennis C.

Currently, he holds the position Sea Grant Professor of Free-Choice Learning at Oregon State University. He is founder and Director Emeritus of the well-known museum research firm, Institute for Learning Innovation, in Annapolis, Maryland and has worked at a variety of other key positions in the museum world, including 14 years at the Smithsonian Institution. Falk earned a joint doctorate in Biology and Education from the University of California, Berkeley. He is the author of over one hundred scholarly articles and chapters in the areas of biology, psychology and education, co-author with Lynn Dierking of <i>The Museum Experience, Learning from Museums: Visitor experiences and the making of meaning</i>, and<i> Lessons without Limit: How free-choice learning is transforming education</i>, with Beverly Sheppard of <i>Thriving in the Knowledge Age: New business models for museums and other cultural institutions</i> and editor of numerous books including <i>Free-Choice Science Education: How we learn science outside of school</i>.<br><br> Lynn Dierking is Sea Grant Professor in Free-Choice Learning at Oregon State University, co-directing a comprehensive learning research program integrating K-12, Collegiate Teaching and Free-Choice Learning concentrations. Over a 30+ year professional career, Lynn has worked in a variety of educational settings: Middle and high school science classrooms, the Smithsonian Office of Educational Research, University of Maryland&#x2019;s College of Education and as director of a middle school curriculum project, Science in American Life, at Smithsonian&#x2019;s National Museum of American History. Her work centers on the long-term learning of children, youth and families, the development and evaluation of community-based efforts and efforts to involve historically under-represented communities in free-choice learning.<p>&#x201c;By updating their seminal work, Falk and Dierking have made <i>The Museum Experience Revisited </i>a must read for museum professionals who want to have the greatest impact on their visitors. With new references to social and digital media, insights into visitor motivations and learning, and suggestions for practitioners, it&#x2019;s again among the most influential of resources.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;Cynthia Vernon, Vice President of Education and Guest Programs, Monterey Bay Aquarium</p><br><br><br><p>&#x201c;The first edition of this book made me&#x2014;and many others&#x2014;fall in love with museum work. This new edition pushes all of us to work with more sensitivity and nuance to make museums as useful and compelling as possible. &#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&#x2014;Nina Simon, Author of <i>The Participatory Museum </i>and the Museum 2.0 blog</p><br><br><br><p>&#x201c;<i>The Museum Experience Revisited </i>will be as powerful a tool for all museums and science centre professionals for the next twenty years as <i>The Museum Experience </i>has been since 1992. It has the fragrance of wisdom and the texture of common sense. I cannot see how anyone in the museum field could possibly survive without reading it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x2014;Professor Per-Edvin Persson, Director of Heureka, The Finnish Science Centre</p><br><br><br>&#x201c;I was new to the profession when I encountered John Falk and Lynn Dierking as they set out to write the first edition of this important book. It helped the museum profession elevate their thinking about the importance of audience at a time when the visitor was thought to be the lesser element of a three part equation with the object and the authority of the institution given much more importance. Falk and Dierking in their persistence helped all of us even the equation. And now we all are much more mature, the field generally recognizes the audience as an equal partner.&nbsp;Falk and Dierking in reissuing this book with new writing elevate the discussion to a new more holistic level of consideration.&nbsp;They are again moving the intellectual bar upward.&#x201d;<p>&#x2014;Elaine Heumann Gurian, Senior Museum Consultant</p><br><br>&#x201c;A museum should be more than a room filled with old stuff. In The <i>Museum Experience Revisited</i>, the modern purpose of the museum and how it must be a place of education and history go together, as John H. Falk &amp; Lynn D. Dierking touch on how the museum should seek to be something experienced instead of simply visited. Studying modern museums and changing trends, <i>The Museum Experience Revisited</i> is a must read for those with a strong curiosity in museums and life, and those who serve as administrators for them.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x2014;The Midwest Book Review<br><br><br>"The authors' <i>The Museum Experience</i> (1992) has proved itself a useful guide to the structure and operations of museums, but Falk and Dierking (both, Oregon State Univ.) give solid reasons for this revision. Museum visitors have tripled in number worldwide, and the number of institutions has doubled. The authors see a "quantum increase in related scholarship," and museums changing somewhat from traditional institutions that host exhibitions to institutions that host exhibitions but do not maintain collections. The authors indicate that the museum's character is changing from being "a nicety in society to a necessity." This book aims to enhance understanding of the museum experience, in part through a focus on organizing visitors' experience via the Contextual Model of Learning, which combines personal, sociocultural, and physical phenomena with an awareness that each visitor comes with individual experiences. The bulk of the book analyzes the museum visit--before, during, and after, with an emphasis on the latter. The last chapter, "Beyond the Visit," aims at the future, with challenging goals that include promoting exchanges of intellectually important ideas, building self-actualization, and more. Most important, according to the authors, tomorrow's museum should be committed to public service and to reinventing its philosophy and practice. Summing Up: Recommended. Upper-division undergraduates, graduate students, and professionals/practitioners."<br><br> &#x2014;CHOICE<br><br>"This incarnation of Falk and Dierking&#x2019;s work is a valuable resource for those in the museum community and specifically those in history institutions. Similar to its initial edition, this text provides a strong foundation for new museum professionals. It also functions well as a refresher for veterans in the industry, providing varied information about current research, theory, and best practices."<br><br> &#x2014;Kristie Smeltzer, <i>History News</i><br><br>"Like a classic rock album that has been digitally remastered, much of the core of the <i>Museum Experience Revisited</i> is reassuringly familiar and reinforces some of the beliefs and practices that are now well established in the field of Museum Education. However, the new research presented amounts to more than a couple of additional bonus tracks and a shiny new cover. For newcomers to visitor studies, the book provides an invaluable summary of what research has been conducted in the audience research field over the last thirty years...For those of us who have been following Falk and Dierking&#x2019;s research for some time, [this book] is a welcome addition to their body of work that usefully addresses the challenges that both museum researchers and practitioners face today."<br> &#x2014;David Francis, Visitor Studies</p><h2>Mythology&#39;s Last Gods: Yahweh and Jesus</h2><p>More than 100 years ago, historians began applying critical methods of documentary analysis to the Judaeo-Christian Bible. To scholars who had hoped to prove the Bible&#39;s authenticity, the results were traumatic.One by one, the various books of the Bible were discovered to contain errors of fact, inaccurate guesses, rationalizations, prophecies ex post facto (usually combined with prophecies of the future that proved inaccurate), and unmistakable, deliberate lies. Such was the power of the churches that, despite the publication of thousands of scholarly books and articles refuting every part of the Judaeo-Christian Bible, to this day the existence of unchallengeable proof that the Bible is a work of fiction is unknown to ninety percent of the population of Christian-dominated societies.For a century this information has been available only to students willing to wade through dozens of books, each of which deals with only one aspect of Judaeo-Christian mythology. It is hoped that, by bringing together information on the origin and development of every part of the Yahweh- and Jesus-myths, Mythology&#39;s Last Gods will make the facts available to a large enough segment of the population to end the equation of god-mythology with history permanently. This is the first book to critically analyze, and take issue with, every section of the Judaeo-Christian Bible from a wholly skeptical, utterly scholarly perspective.Mythology&#39;s Last Gods is a comprehensive history of the development of Judaeo-Christian god-mythology. Harwood traces the beginning of the &#34;god&#34; concept, the evolution of Judaism to the first century, and the evolution of Christianity from its monotheistic beginnings to its emergence as a three-god creed in A.D. 325. Harwood&#39;s work reveals many things including that Jesus the Nazarite preached only Essene Judaism, and that every teaching attributed to him can be traced to a pre-Christian source.</p><p><b>William R.

As late as 1903, W.E.B. Du Bois observed that African American spirituals had led naive whites to believe that "life was joyous to the black slave, careless and happy." While these misconceptions have largely disappeared, the history of African American culture--and its importance to American history as a whole--is still a subject little understood by the majority of Americans.<br> In <em>Going Through the Storm</em>, Sterling Stuckey offers a compelling look at one of the world's richest cultural traditions. He traces the fertile legacy of African American art from its roots in tribal myth, through its blossoming in slave music and dance, to its fruition in the great gospel-singing movements of the 1960s. In the process he shows how this tradition, grounded as it was in adversity, represents one of the great triumphs of the human spirit: slaves and their descendants, by way of Negro spirituals, the blues, and jazz, transformed the pain of oppression into a transcendent and timeless beauty. And, as he explores these various styles, Stuckey reveals that the development of a distinctive African American aesthetic follows (and helps illuminate) the course of the nation's history.<br> In a series of engaging, lucidly written essays, <em>Going through the Storm</em> covers the entire spectrum of African American culture, offering along the way many fresh and important insights. Within the context of slavery and slave music, Stuckey presents a new look at the foundations of black nationalism and the civil rights movement. In his eloquent reflections on Paul Robeson, he shows how black art offers a commentary on the human spirit so genuine and resonant that its appeal has reached across the boundaries of race to touch most of humanity. Writing of Herman Melville, he demonstrates how the great novelist was struck with the importance of African culture in history--and the reciprocal relationship of history to African culture--and carefully explored this theme in <em>Benito Cereno</em>. Frederick Douglass is presented for the first time as a major theorist of African American culture, one whose thought is profoundly relevant to our current debates on culture and race. And, perhaps most important, Stuckey explains that because black artists have been deeply interested for so long in the question of oppression, their art is of particular use to historians. In what amounts to nothing less than a revolutionary approach, Stuckey considers the uses of music <em>as</em> history, arguing that an easing of barriers between academic disciplines will lead to a better understanding of human life in general.<br> A timely, readable, and often moving volume, <em>Going Through the Storm</em> not only expands our understanding of black music, dance, literature, and folklore, but provides a new vantage point from which to view the entire landscape of American culture.<br></p><p>Going Through the Storm covers the entire spectrum of African American culture, presenting a new look at the foundations of black culture and the civil right movement within the context of slavery and slave music.

This applies not only to obvious candidates such as asbestos, lead, and gasoline, but also to compounds such as caffeine and headache tablets. While the field of toxicology has numerous texts devoted to aspects of biology, chemistry, and mechanism of action, the need remains for a book that places toxicology within the framework of our daily lives.<br>A Small Dose of Toxicology presents the principles of toxicology by exploring the effects of common chemical agents such as caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol. It reviews the fundamentals of dose-response and factors of individual sensitivity in regard to these drugs, and then applies this knowledge to environmental contaminates such as lead, arsenic, pesticides, mercury, and radiation. Chapters discuss neurotoxicology, risk assessment, carcinogenicity, and with a variety of specific toxic agents, with each chapter designed as a self-contained module to allow for flexibility in the selection of personal or academic material. <br><br>Exploring current toxicology concerns within a human context, this text discusses how toxicology affects our everyday lives while providing insight into the broader issues of public health and disease prevention. Environmental and public health professionals, as well as novices and students requiring a basic foundation in toxicology will find this resource incredibly useful.</p><p>Stephen G. Gilbert is Director of the Institute of Neurotoxicology and Neurological Disorders and Affiliate Associate Professor at the Department of Environmental Health at the University of Washington, USA.&#34;The passionate concerns that many of us hold-for protecting animal habitat, water quality, or the health of our most vulnerable people-often are not coupled with a solid understanding of why some substances are harmful. So I was personally delighted to find some of the grounding I needed in [this book]. The short chapters and straightforward approach present the information with great clarity.&#34; - GenerationGreen.org &#34;I found this book to be a delightful text that reminded me of all the wonderful ways in which toxicology impacts our lives . It is a great primer for young people considering a career in the field, but, importantly, is also an excellent text for introducing the topic to the general public, something that I feel has historically been lacking. The author should be commended for his efforts in compiling this text.&#34; - BTS Newsletter &#34;We distributed your book to all of our teachers and it was a GREAT hit. Thanks again for writing such a great book for teachers.&#34; - Terry Pittman</p><h2>Introduction to Investigations</h2><p>INTRODUCTION TO INVESTIGATIONS, Second Edition is a basic introductory text for college students who are interested in learning who investigators are, what they do, and how they do it.

Other leading political figures, such as Henry Clay and Daniel Webster, are paid due attention and discussions of the vital issues of the day-the Bank War, Indian removal, the states&#39; rights conflict, and slavery-are nicely balanced by attention to the era&#39;s various reform, religious, and artistic movements. In addition to the newest research and revelations, new to the Second Edition is an extensive photo essay. Written by one of the foremost authorities on Andrew Jackson, The Jacksonian Era is simply a great read for anyone interested in Jackson and his time.</p><p><p><b>Robert V. Remini,</b> preeminent authority of the life and times of Andrew Jackson, was a History and Research Professor of the Humanities emeritus at the University of Illinois at Chicago, where he taught and did scholarly research beginning in 1965.

It explains step-by-step how to sort through reasons, evaluate evidence, and tell when a claim (no matter how strange) is likely to be true. The emphasis is neither on debunking nor on advocating specific assertions, but on explaining principles of critical thinking that enable readers to evaluate claims for themselves. The authors focus on types of logical arguments and proofs, making How to Think about Weird Things a versatile supplement for logic, critical thinking, philosophy of science, or any other science appreciation courses.</p><p></p><h2>Yoga sutras: The textbook of Yoga psychology</h2><p>The Textbook of Yoga Psychology, written by noted Sanskrit scholar and yogi Ramamurti S. Mishra, M.D., combines his definitive translation with an inspiring interpretation of Patanjali's Yoga Sutras. Patanjali's ancient formulae for self-analysis make this text crucial to the proper understanding of the philosophy, psychology and practice of Yoga. An extensive Introduction provides a lucid and thorough examination of the Sankhya Yoga Philosophy from which the Yoga Sutras emerged. <p>The accessibility of Dr. Mishra's translation of the Yoga Sutras has made this the favorite among beginning Yoga students, while experienced yogis and novices both appreciate the clarity of his commentaries on each sutra. Dr. Mishra's interpretation is unique in placing this ancient work in a modern context, examining Yoga psychology in the light of recent advances in psychiatry, psychology and parapsychology. </p><p>Increasing its value as a reference, this edition features a new Appendix with the entire text of the Yoga Sutras in the original Sanskrit and in a transliterated form, with a revised, literal English translation by the author.</p></p><p>Shri Brahmananda Sarasvati, also known as Ramamurti S. Mishra, M.D., had an extensive background in Eastern and Western medicine. In 1955, after years of practicing and teaching medicine and surgery in his native India, he came to the West for further research and advanced medical studies. In the years that followed, he served as a resident physician at leading university hospitals in the United States and Canada. <p>In 1958, Dr. Mishra (Shri Brahmananda) founded the Yoga Society of New York, Inc. In 1966 he gave up his medical career to concentrate on his spiritual teaching, founding ashrams and centers of meditation and learning in the United States, Canada and Europe. His two leading centers today are Ananda Ashram in Monroe, New York (opened in 1964 as the country retreat center for the Yoga Society of New York) and Brahmananda Ashram (founded in 1973 at the Yoga Society of San Francisco, Inc.).

So it's not surprising that three out of four Americans say they feel more fearful today then they did twenty years ago. But are we living in exceptionally dangerous times? In <i>The Culture of Fear</i>, sociologist Barry Glassner demonstrates that it is our <i>perception</i> of danger that has increased, not the actual level of risk. Glassner exposes the people and organizations that manipulate our perceptions and profit from our fears, including advocacy groups that raise money by exaggerating the prevalence of particular diseases and politicians who win elections by heightening concerns about crime, drug use, and terrorism. In this new edition of a classic book&#x2014;more relevant now than when it was first published&#x2014;Glassner exposes the price we pay for social panic.</p><p><b>Barry Glassner</b> is professor of sociology at the University of Southern California.

The Art of Deception</h2><p>What is a fake and why are fakes made? Did the forgers of the Turin Shroud and Piltdown Man have the same motives? Does a famous Vermeer cease to be beautiful when it turns out to be a Van Meegeren? Is the Piranesi Vase an eighteenth-century masterpiece or a faked-up antique? Fakes, argue the contributors to this volume, have always been unjustly neglected, especially given the unparalleled evidence they provide of the values and perceptions of both those who make them and those who commission them.<br><br>Included in this major survey of fakes and forgeries from ancient Babylonia to the present day are more than 600 objects from the British Museum and other outstanding collections. There are spectacular fakes once hailed as masterpieces of ancient and modern art. There are musical instruments and manuscripts, Chinese bronzes and Chelsea porcelain. There are literary and documentary frauds and political forgeries that have changed the course of history.<br><br> Both the methods of making fakes and the recent scientific advances in their detection are described, but many puzzles remain. The book concludes with a discussion of intriguing cases like the Vinland Map, the "Aztec" rock-crystal skull, and the mysterious discoveries at Glozel, which continue to perplex curator, historian, and scientist alike.</p><p><b>Mark Jones</b> is Assistant Keeper, Department of Coins and Medals, British Museum.

The answers, often unclear, depend as much upon country and zeitgeist as upon the intent of the maker. The authors also remind us that faking is an important clue to the social history of an age (i.e., what's popular and why), although it can and often does distort our understanding and appreciation of the past. Several short chapters deal with the history of fakes and faking (not only of art but also of fossils, literature, historical documents, etc.) from the earliest times to the fake Rolex watches of today. An extensively annotated exhibition catalog follows. Concluding chapters deal with methods of faking, means of detecting fakes, and a discussion of items that are still under dispute and for which scientific and artistic or historical evidence do not seem to agree.

Not sure how to classify the binding. Purchased Jan. 2014 from NCSU Bookstore.</p><p>This fascinating new book chronicles such significant twentieth-century technological failures as the <i>Hindenburgh</i>, Love Canal, the <i>Challenger</i>, and thalidomide. Assisted by contributing editor Leonard Bruno, senior science specialist at the Library of Congress, and several distinguished advisers, Schlager has compiled entries on 103 technological disasters in a wide variety of fields. Entries were written by contributors who are experts in science, architecture, and engineering or journalists who specialize in technological subjects.<p>The book is international in scope and surveys 12 fields, such as automobiles, bridges, dams, and submarines. The fields are arranged alphabetically and within each, entries are arranged chronologically. All are signed and written in a nontechnical style comprehensible to the average educated adult. Each entry is in the same format. A heading notes the place and date of the disaster, and a one-sentence description gives the significance of the incident. A background section relates how the project was designed. This is followed by sections detailing the disaster and the impact it has had on the field. Rounding out each article is a bibliography listing a handful of books and articles, though some are more extensive, e.g., <i>Chernobyl</i> has 18 citations. Appropriately placed throughout the text are approximately 150 black-and-white photographs and line drawings.</p><p>Facilitating use of this work is a table of contents with a one-sentence annotation for each entry. The contributors list notes affiliation, expertise area, and publications. A chronology lists the events. Concluding the volume is a bibliography that cites 49 books and a detailed index.</p><p>There are a number of reference books on disasters; <i>Man-Made Catastrophes</i> [<i>RBB</i> Ja 1 93] invites comparison. It covers disasters from ancient times to the present, rather than just the twentieth century. There is some duplication in disasters covered, but the two books have different purposes. <i>Man-Made Catastrophes</i> recounts the human tragedy while <i>When Technology Fails</i> emphasizes the technological significance of the event and what we can learn from it. Thus, these two titles are complementary. High-school, college, and public libraries will want to consider adding <i>When Technology Fails</i> to their collections. <i></i></p>This fascinating reference book provides detailed case studies of more than 100 significant failures of modern technology. The incidents covered represent a variety of fields, ranging from transportation to civil engineering to the environment and include notable disasters involving aircraft and other vehicles, bridges and buildings, chemical facilities, medicine, spacecraft, and nuclear power. Arranged by broad subject categories and often accompanied by photos, charts, and diagrams, the 1000- to 1500-word entries are written by experts who discuss the background, details, and impact of the event. Each entry concludes with a list of sources for further study. This work offers an interesting perspective on our technological failures and valuable insight into their background, causes, and effects.

This question is of tremendous importance in both academic and policy-making circles and one that has been debated by political scientists for years. The Clinton administration, in particular, has argued that the United States should endeavor to promote democracy around the world. This timely reader includes some of the most influential articles in the debate that have appeared in the journal <i>International Security</i> during the past two years, adding two seminal pieces published elsewhere to make a more balanced and complete collection, suitable for classroom use.</p></p><p>This volume collects important essays that have advanced and challenged the idea of a democratic peace. The first section of the book presents several seminal essays that argue that the democratic peace exists and is not spurious or epiphenomenal. The authors contend the democracies rarely go to war with one another, and that democratic peace is the result of characteristics of democracies.Michael E.

Set in an Atlantic world context, the book highlights the interplay between Spain and America as the Spanish empire struggled for survival amid the fierce international competition that dominated the eighteenth century. The authors use extensive research in the repositories of Spain and America, as well as innovative consultation of the French Foreign Affairs archive, to bring into focus the poorly understood reformist efforts of the early Bourbons, which laid the foundation for the better-known agenda of Charles III. As the book unfolds, the narrative puts flesh on the men and women who, for better or worse, influenced colonial governance. It is the story of power, ambition, and idealism at the highest levels.</p><p>This book covers the evolution of royal policy in Spanish America as eighteenth-century Spain modernized its empire and transformed itself into a power of the first order. Tracing the interplay between war and reform, the analysis confronts the diverse realities of the Spanish Atlantic world, which stretched from the northern Mexican borderlands to Argentina and Chile. Unlike earlier studies on eighteenth-century Spain, this work incorporates the early Bourbon experience into the narrative and integrates the impressive reemergence of the Royal Armada into a fuller picture of administrative, commercial, fiscal, ecclesiastical, and military change.Allan J. Kuethe is an acadï¿½mico correspondiente of the Spanish Royal Academy of History and has published extensively on eighteenth-century Spain and America both in the United States and in Europe.

Once relegated to the underground and midnight movie circuit, these films and their bombastic advertisements are experiencing a surge of mainstream popularity driven by fans appreciative of the artistic skill, distinctive aesthetic, and unabashed sensationalism they relied on to make a profit, with the quality of the poster often far surpassing that of the film itself. The book celebrates this tradition with sections divided into &#34;moral panic&#34; films, action, horror, sci-fi, and of course, sex, each introduced with short essays by genre experts such as Kim Newman, Eric Schaffer, Simon Sheridan, Vern, and author Stephen Jones, winner of the Horror Writer&#39;s Association 2015 Bram Stoker Award for Non-Fiction. Edited by Adam Newell and featuring an introduction by author and filmmaker Pete Tombs, The Art of the B Movie Poster is a loving tribute to the artwork and artists that brought biker gangs, jungle girls, James Bond rip-offs and reefer heads to life for audiences around the world.</p><p>'. . . one more seminal text is about to be added to the canon: THE ART OF THE B-MOVIE POSTER from Gingko Press. The book is a veritable photographic study of exploitation advertising, interspersed with essays discussing the evolution of grindhouse cinema from the 30s until the death of Times Square. The text is a massive undertaking, and contains what seems to be reprints of nearly every movie poster to have ever graced Times Square, the Tenderloin, and your local dive theatre.' --Rue Morgue Magazine<br><br>'The Art of the B-Movie Poster offers a stark contrast to the current climate, where movie posters is slapped together in Photoshop with little artistic integrity for digital consumption.

It offers a straightforward, step-by-step approach that can be used in any conflict at home or in business; in local, national, or international arenas. Juergensmeyer sets out Gandhi&#x2019;s basic methods and illustrates them with practical examples to show how parties at odds can rise above a narrow view of self-interest to find resolutions that are satisfying and beneficial to all involved. The author pits Gandhi&#x2019;s ideas against those of other great social thinkers in a series of imaginary debates that challenge and clarify Gandhi&#x2019;s thinking on issues of violence, anger, and love.

The text relates the subject matter to concepts that students already know and motivates these ideas with numerous examples. Special topics in later chapters deal with current research including the Bergman kernel function, Hp spaces, and the Bell-Ligocka approach to proving smoothness to the boundary of biholomorphic mappings.

It would be easy for young believers&#x2015;removed from Christ&#x2019;s life, death, and resurrection by a generation and surrounded by a hostile government and unbelieving neighbors&#x2015;to have doubts and second thoughts about their faith. This book was written in the late 80s after the terrible persecutions of Nero (A.D. 54-68) and the total destruction of Jerusalem (A.D. 70). The church had flourished under persecution, but believers needed reassurance of the truth of Christianity. John, a venerable eyewitness to all that Jesus had done and faithful follower of his Lord, would give that assurance through his personal account of the gospel story.

Schechter, M.D.</b>, conducts a neurological private practice and is a clinical assistant professor of neurology at Wayne State University.A simple, sympathetic guide to coping with a progressive, disabling brain disorder. Physician Cram was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease ten years ago. Here he matches his personal experience with his experiences treating other patients with the disease, the result is real hope for good health. Cram is a firm believer in four elements to self-help: a positive attitude, information about the disease; partnership with a knowledgeable physician, and a willingness to take action, to do the things ``that make you feel better, help slow the disability, and keep you as independent as possible for as long as possible.'' Thus, he first explains the disease: its hallmarks are trembling in the hands, arms, legs, jaw, and face; stiffness and rigidity of the limbs and torso; slowness of movement; and impaired balance and coordination. There are other possible symptoms, from depression to changes in speech. Cram goes on to explain the overall progression of the disease through five stages. The hope he offers is that early self-help and medication may delay or even prevent the later stages. He looks at length at emotional considerations, diet, exercise, and other lifestyle needs, as well as present and possible future medical treatments. Cram also is careful to include practical help and encouragement for caregivers. Kind, practical, and thorough, a valuable starting point. -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1999, Kirkus Associates, LP.

It has tempted filmmakers, and most recently animators, who have exploited its dramatic content to good effect but have inevitably lost some of the grays that make the original text so compelling.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; From Victor Hugo's flamboyant imagination came Quasimodo, the grotesque bell ringer; La Esmeralda, the sensuous gypsy dancer; and the haunted archdeacon Claude Frollo. Hugo set his epic tale in the Paris of 1482 under Louis XI and meticulously re-created the <br>day-to-day life of its highest and lowest inhabitants. Written at a time of perennial political upheaval in France, The Hunchback of Notre-Dame&nbsp;&nbsp;is the product of an emerging democratic sensibility and prefigures the teeming masterpiece Les Misï¿½rables, which Hugo would write thirty years later.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; He made the cathedral the centerpiece of the novel and called it Notre-Dame de Paris. (It received its popular English title at the time of its second translation in 1833.) Hugo wrote that his inspiration came from a carving of the word "fatality" in Greek that he had found in the cathedral. The inscription had been eradicated by the time the book was published, and Hugo feared that Notre-Dame's Gothic splendor might soon be lost to the contemporary fad for tearing down old buildings. Notre-Dame has survived as one of the great monuments of Paris, and Hugo's novel is a fitting celebration of it, a popular classic that is proving to be just as enduring.<br><br>The Modern Library has played a significant role in American cultural life for the better part of a century.

As early as 1645, the Massachusetts Bay Colony began to prohibit the entry of &#x201c;paupers.&#x201d; Today, however, the notion that immigration is universally beneficial has become pervasive. To many modern economists, immigrants are a trove of much-needed workers who can fill predetermined slots along the proverbial assembly line.</p><p>But this view of immigration&#x2019;s impact is overly simplified, explains George J. Borjas, a Cuban-American, Harvard labor economist. Immigrants are more than just workers&#x2015;they&#x2019;re people who have lives outside of the factory gates and who may or may not fit the ideal of the country to which they&#x2019;ve come to live and work. Like the rest of us, they&#x2019;re protected by social insurance programs, and the choices they make are affected by their social environments.</p><p>In <em>We Wanted Workers</em>, Borjas pulls back the curtain of political bluster to show that, in the grand scheme, immigration has not affected the average American all that much. But it has created winners and losers. The losers tend to be nonmigrant workers who compete for the same jobs as immigrants. And somebody&#x2019;s lower wage is somebody else&#x2019;s higher profit, so those who employ immigrants benefit handsomely. In the end, immigration is mainly just another government redistribution program.</p><p>&#x201c;I am an immigrant,&#x201d; writes Borjas, &#x201c;and yet I do not buy into the notion that immigration is universally beneficial. . . . But I still feel that it is a good thing to give some of the poor and huddled masses, people who face so many hardships, a chance to experience the incredible opportunities that our exceptional country has to offer.&#x201d; Whether you&#x2019;re a Democrat, a Republican, or an Independent, <em>We Wanted Workers</em> is essential reading for anyone interested in the issue of immigration in America today.</p></p><p>George J. Borjas is the Robert W. Scrivner Professor of Economics and Social Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School. He is the recipient of the 2011 IZA Prize in Labor Economics.&#x201c;"However much you think you know about immigration, you'll learn something from this book. And buy a second copy for your congressman&#x2015;he needs it even more than you do."&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Mark Krikorian, <em>The National Review</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;"A readable and detailed historical tour of America&#x2019;s immigration debates and policies....[Borjas] generously provides readers with arguments on all sides."&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;An intriguing, clearly written polemic.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Kirkus Reviews</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;One of America&#x2019;s leading immigration economists presents a level-headed exploration of the effects of immigration on migrant and nonmigrant workers.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Publishers Weekly</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;<em>We Wanted Workers</em> is essential to understanding America&#x2019;s future. Drawing on decades of research, Borjas cuts through the myths and obfuscations plaguing our immigration debate. This is the most lucid, powerful work of social science I&#x2019;ve ever read.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Reihan Salam, executive editor, <em>National Review</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;An invaluable addition to the literature on U.S. immigration policy. A model of lucid exposition, it delves deeply into the subtle complexities of a subject that has been rife with sloppy and wishful thinking. Borjas reviews a mountain of evidence in support of a forceful argument for the position that, while there are benefits, one needs also to be mindful of the considerable costs associated with the liberalization of immigration policies.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Glenn C. Loury, Merton P. Stolz Professor of the Social Sciences, Brown University</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Borjas, the world&#x2019;s leading economic expert on immigration, has penned a nontechnical, nearly conversational book pointing out all the issues in immigration&#x2019;s effects on an economy&#x2015;particularly the American economy. The central message is &#x2018;it depends&#x2019;&#x2015;impacts are positive or negative for different natives, different kinds of immigrants, and at different times. With immigration again a central political issue, this book is must-reading for every voter.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Daniel Hamermesh, Institute for the Study of Labor (IZA) and Royal Holloway University of London</strong><br><br>&#x201c;&#x2018;Wir riefen Arbeitskrï¿½fte, es kamen Menschen&#x2015;We wanted workers, people came.&#x2019; Max Frisch&#x2019;s comment on the economically motivated after-war migrations from Southern Europe and Turkey into Northern Europe lends this fascinating book its title, and points at the core of what distinguishes movement of people from movement of goods. It is this aspect of migration that Borjas emphasizes alongside the economic dimensions, when he ventures in a thoughtful and well-structured way through the various facets of migration. This excellent book is also very personal, telling the story of the migrant George Borjas who arrives as a child refugee from Castro&#x2019;s Cuba and the life&#x2019;s work of the economist George Borjas, pointing at how personal experience has influenced highly acclaimed academic work. A captivating, insightful and easily accessible book that makes great reading for everyone interested in the subject.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Christian Dustmann, University College London</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Lucid and illuminating.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Binyamin Appelbaum, correspondent for <em>The New York Times</em></strong></p><h2>Gathering: Memoir of a Seed Saver</h2><p><p>Daughter of Iowa farmers, Missouri homesteader, and mother of five, Diane Ott Whealy never anticipated that one day she would become a leader in a grass-roots movement to preserve our agricultural biodiversity. The love for the land and the respect for heirloom seeds that Diane shared with her husband, Kent Whealy, led to their starting Seed Savers Exchange in 1975.</p> <p>Seed Savers Exchange, the nation's premier nonprofit seed-saving organization, began humbly as a simple exchange of seeds among passionate gardeners who sought to preserve the rich gardening heritage their ancestors had brought to this country. Seeds that Ott Whealy herself inherited from her paternal grandparents were the impetus for the formation of Seed Savers Exchange, whose membership has grown from a small coterie to more than thirteen thousand. Its influence has been felt in gardens across America.</p> <p>Ott Whealy's down-to-earth narrative traces her fascinating journey from Oregon to Kansas to Missouri then back home to Iowa where, in 1986, Heritage Farm became the permanent home of Seed Savers Exchange. Her heartwarming story captures what is best in the American spirit: the ability to dream and, through hard work and perseverance, inspire others to contribute their efforts to a cause. Thus was created one of the nation's most admired nonprofits in the field of genetic preservation.<br> <br> </p></p><p><p>Diane Ott Whealy is the co-founder of Seed Savers Exchange and presently serves as Vice President of Education. For more than 35 years, Diane has been a national leader in the heirloom seed movement and a strong advocate for the protection of the earth's rare genetic food stocks. Founded in 1975 as a non-profit organization, Seed Savers Exchange has more than 13,000 members, made up of gardeners, orchardist, chefs and plant collectors, dedicated to the preservation and distribution of heirloom varieties of vegetables, fruits, grains, flowers and herbs. With thousands of varieties in its collection, Seed Savers is one of the largest non-governmental seed banks in the United States. In 1986 Diane helped to develop Heritage Farm, Seed Saver's scenic 890-acre headquarters near Decorah Iowa. Heritage Farm is a unique educational center designed to maintain and display collections of endangered food crops. Diane also founded the Flower and Herb Exchange where members offer over 2000 heirloom flowers and herbs for exchange each year.

Included is an essay on how to look at Greek vases and another on the conservation of ancient ceramics. These essays provide succinct explanations of the terms most frequently encountered by museum-goers. The concise definitions are divided into two sections, one on potters and painters and another on vase shapes and technical terms relating to the construction and decoration of the vases. Featuring numerous color illustrations of Greek vases, many from the Getty Museum's collection, <em>Understanding Greek Vases</em> is an indispensable guide for anyone wishing to obtain a greater understanding and enjoyment of Greek ceramics.</p><p><br><strong>Andrew J.

Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles is well organized and more comprehensive than the previous volumes in the series (others include European sculpture, illuminated manuscripts, etc.). Intended for general readers and museum visitors, it is more than just a dictionary of Greek vases. Greek ceramics scholar Clark includes a first chapter, "Looking at Ceramics," which gives background by explaining why and how Greek vases are studied. Because most of the Greek vases that remain today are broken and dirty, Maya Elston, associate curator of antiquities conservation at the Getty Museum, has also included a chapter on antique vase care and conservation. The glossaries that follow cover potters, painters, vase shapes, and such technical terms as alabastron, amphora, hyrdia, kythos, and oon. Beautiful and plentiful reproductions add richly to the scholarly text. What sets this book apart from other similar titles (e.g., any of the John Boardman texts) is the nonspecialist perspective and the addition of the conservation chapter. The book is concise yet packed with general information.

Their stories frame this fascinating look at the extraordinary history of the Gullah culture. The existence of the Gullahs went almost unnoticed until the 1860s, when missionaries from Philadelphia made their way to St. Helena Island, South Carolina, to establish the Penn School to help freed slaves learn to read and write. There, they discovered hidden pockets of a bygone African culture with its own language, traditions, medicine, weaving, and art. Today, more than 300,000 Gullah people live in the remote areas of the sea islands of St. Helena, Edisto, Coosay, Ossabaw, Sapelo, Daufuski, and Cumberland, their way of life endangered by overdevelopment in an increasingly popular tourist destination. Having evolved from the original Penn School, the Penn Center, based on St. Helena Island, works to preserve and document the Gullah and Geechee cultures. Author Wilbur Cross originally set out to make the excellent work of the Penn Center known and to introduce the Gullah culture to people in America. He became entranced with the Gullah way of life and ended up with 12 chapters that explore the various facets of Gullah culture. <em>Gullah Culture in America</em> not only explores the history of Gullah but also shows readers what it&#x2019;s like to grow up and live in this unique American community.</p> <p>After receiving his degree from Yale University, Wilbur Cross served in the United States Navy and started a career as a copywriter in New York.

Commercial fisheries have devastated the populations of deep-water fish like oreos or orange roughies, animals that can live more than 100 years and take 20 or 30 years to reach sexual maturity. The hunting of great whales has not only decimated whale populations, but also diminished the unique, startlingly rich habitats created when whales die and sink to the sea floor. Cold-water corals that grow perhaps an inch a year, in reefs up to 10,000 years old, are being wiped out by bottom trawlers. 'Today,' Koslow writes, 'virtually no part of the deep-sea fauna remains unaffected by man's activities.'"

[An] exhaustively researched and referenced volume with a historical review stretching back to Socrates. . . . [A] cerebral introduction to the wonders of the abyss that could awaken many to the idea that, as Koslow puts it, exploration and protection of the deep sea 'is one of the great scientific voyages of discovery, one that humankind has only just embarked upon.' " (Mark Schrope <i>Nature</i> 2007-06-21)<br><br>"The deep ocean was once thought to be a lifeless abyss. Within the past 50 years, however, improved exploration techniques have revealed, at depths below 200 meters, a habitat that's teeming with life. Koslow chronicles the history of deep-sea exploration, from a late 19th-century expedition to present-day, high-tech exploration of deep trenches. He explores the question of how so many species reside in a place that would seem hostile to living things. He also explains the science of tectonic movements and hydrothermal vents. Finally, Koslow analyzes the human impact on the deep sea. Its remoteness and vastness once made it seem the perfect dumping site for sewage, toxic chemicals, and even nuclear waste. However, such pollutants are building up in the deep water and in the animals that live there. He ends his book with proposals for protecting this vast, intriguing ecosystem."

The historical review of deep-sea biology is the most comprehensive I have read, and any reader will enjoy the signature discoveries and rapid Kuhnian paradigm shifts: the deep sea as a lifeless, dead zone (until 1860s), the deep sea as a reserve of archaic living fossils (1860s&#x2013;90s), the deep sea rich in life to its greatest depths, but generally depauperate compared to shallow water (1890s&#x2013;1960s), the deep sea rivalling tropical rainforests for biodiversity (1960s onwards), the deep sea as a habitat for incredible hydrothermal vent communities, independent of the sun (1977 onwards)."

I hope ecologists and policy-makers will read Tony Koslow&#x2019;s book, because it describes a world that is poorly known by the vast majority of scientists and remains unseen by most of humanity. <i>The Silent Deep</i>, along with the photo essays like the extraordinary coffee-table book <i>The Deep</i>, should draw the attention of a wider audience to this obscure realm.

By the time she was thirty, she had written four novels in French. In 1962, she abandoned fiction writing in French and devoted herself the teaching history at the University of Algiers. During the ensuing twelve years, she tried to tackle the problem of the transition from writing in French to writing in Arabic. She found a partial solution to this problem in the cinema with her film La Nouba des femmes du Mont Chenoua, which was awarded the Critic's Prize at the Venice Biennal 1979. In 1980 Assia published a volume of short stories dealing with the lives of contemporary urban Algerian women: Femmes d'Alger dans leur appartemen. Assia Djebar's work has been known to the English reader primarily through the translation of her first novel La Soif (1957) under the title of The Mischief.

An analysis of Matisse's self-portraits is also provided. Klein works chronologically, detailing the artist's developing style, but remains attached to his biography as well, with many quotes about Matisse or his works from contemporary sources. The oversize volume (10x11.75&lt;"&gt;) is well illustrated with b&amp;w and color plates. Annotation c. Book News, Inc., Portland, OR (booknews.com)</p><p>John Klein is associate professor of art history at University of Missouri- Columbia.<p>Klein (art history, Univ. of Missouri, Columbia) uses Matisse's portraits to illustrate various aspects of portraiture, from the social, philosophical, historical, and psychological to the purely painterly. Through vivid descriptions of the paintings and discussions of the artist's relationships with his sitters family, friends, patrons, colleagues, etc. he develops the initial broad theoretical discussion of portraiture into a particular chronological analysis of the meaning of portrait painting to Matisse's life and work. Some of Matisse's paintings of his wife are distant, while portraits of his daughter seem more intimate, however isolated she may appear. Especially interesting is the artist's portrayal of himself throughout his life, revealing his introspection, integrity, and persona. John Russell's Matisse: Father and Son (LJ 5/15/99) will satisfy the desire for more details on the artist's character and family life. Here, however, Klein provides a novel approach to understanding one of the 20th century's most important artists as well as a fresh definition of a heretofore ill-defined genre. Lush illustrations are plentiful throughout. Artists and art students interested in portraiture, as well as specialists, will want this book.

Josef won a considerable reputation as a painter of the Cubist school, later developing his own playful primitive style. He collaborated with his brother in composing sketches, stories, and plays, as well as writing two short novels of his own and critical essays in which he defended the art of the unconscious, of children, and of savages. Following Hitler&#39;s invasion of 1939, Josef Capek was sent to a German concentration camp. He died at Belsen in April 1945. Karel Capek became a journalist and for a time stage manager of the theatre in Vinohrady. Though a writer of novels, visionary romances, travel books, stories , and essays, Karel is best known for his plays. His last plays, written just before the entry of Hitler into Czechoslovakia, deal with the rise of dictatorship and the terrible consequences of war. Karel Capek died on Christmas day, 1938. After the success of R.U.R. (Rossums&#39; Universal Robots, 1920) seen in London in 1923, the brothers collaborated in their best-known work, The Insect Play (1921). Both plays are satires depicting the horrors of a regimented technical world and the terrible end of the populace if they fail to rise against their oppressors. They reflect the world in which the Capeks lived and give a commentary on its grosser follies.</p><p>Both of the plays in this volume depict the horrors of a regimented technological world and the terrible end of the populace if it fails to rise against its oppressors.

This book offers a simple explanation: corporations and the government together dispossess rural people of their prosperity, and even their property. Based on four years of fieldwork, this eye-opening assessment by sociologist Loka Ashwood plays out in a mixed-race Georgia community that hosted the first nuclear power reactors sanctioned by the government in three decades. This work serves as an explanatory mirror of prominent trends in current American politics. Churches become havens for redemption, poaching a means of retribution, guns a tool of self-defense, and nuclear power a faltering solution to global warming as governance strays from democratic principles. In the absence of hope or trust in rulers, rural racial tensions fester and divide. The book tells of the rebellion that unfolds as the rights of corporations supersede the rights of humans.</p><p><b>Loka Ashwood</b> is assistant professor in the department of agricultural economics and rural sociology at Auburn University.

Beginning with the legacies of Greek and Roman life and thought, Rommen traces the natural law tradition to its displacement by legal positivism and concludes with what the author calls "the reappearance" of natural law thought in more recent times. In seven chapters each Rommen explores "The History of the Idea of Natural Law" and "The Philosophy and Content of the Natural Law." In his introduction, Russell Hittinger places Rommen's work in the context of contemporary debate on the relevance of natural law to philosophical inquiry and constitutional interpretation.</p><p><b>Heinrich Rommen</b> (1897&#x2013;1967) taught in Germany and England before concluding his distinguished scholarly career at Georgetown University.</p><p><b>Russell Hittinger</b> is William K.

(<i>The Wayback Times</i>)</p><h2>Recycling Reconsidered: The Present Failure and Future Promise of Environmental Action in the United States (Urban and Industrial Environments)</h2><p><p><b>How the success and popularity of recycling has diverted attention from the steep environmental costs of manufacturing the goods we consume and discard.</b></p><p>Recycling is widely celebrated as an environmental success story. The accomplishments of the recycling movement can be seen in municipal practice, a thriving private recycling industry, and widespread public support and participation. In the United States, more people recycle than vote. But, as Samantha MacBride points out in this book, the goals of recycling&#x2015;saving the earth (and trees), conserving resources, and greening the economy&#x2015;are still far from being realized. The vast majority of solid wastes are still burned or buried. MacBride argues that, since the emergence of the recycling movement in 1970, manufacturers of products that end up in waste have successfully prevented the implementation of more onerous, yet far more effective, forms of sustainable waste policy. Recycling as we know it today generates the illusion of progress while allowing industry to maintain the status quo and place responsibility on consumers and local government.</p><p>MacBride offers a series of case studies in recycling that pose provocative questions about whether the current ways we deal with waste are really the best ways to bring about real sustainability and environmental justice. She does not aim to debunk or discourage recycling but to help us think beyond recycling as it is today.</p></p><p>Samantha MacBride teaches at Columbia University&#39;s School of Public and International Affairs and is a professional in local waste governance.<p>As the title implies, Samantha MacBride's <i>Recycling Reconsidered</i> takes a serious, timely, and unvarnished look at recycling in the United States. Her agenda is clearly utilitarian&#x2015;not to convince us of the environmental virtues of recycling or to offer a cynical appraisal of why it doesn't work but to ask thoughtful questions and make reasonable suggestions well beyond the often trite assessments that regularly appear in printYou can argue with her conclusions, but you cannot dismiss her data, her careful analysis, and her no-nonsense approach.</p>&#x2015;<b>Martin V. Melosi</b>, author of <i>The Sanitary City</i><br><br><p>By charting the waste cycle from curbside collector to the corporate polluter, MacBride reveals layer after layer of the recycling and waste management conundrum, building on and extending previous studies of American waste. In so doing, she has widened our understanding of a very complex issue for contemporary society. For this MacBride should be commended, and <i>Recycling Reconsidered</i> should be added to all relevant readings lists in environmental sociology, contemporary anthropology, social geography, and urban planning.</p>&#x2015;<b>Dr. Liam Leonard</b>, Lecturer in Sociology, Criminology and Human Rights, Institute of Technology, Sligo, Ireland<br><br><p>Samantha MacBride has produced an outstanding study that asks profound sociological questions about the way our recycling systems are organized. Her concept of 'busy-ness' is right on target: consumers, environmentalists, and governments are <i>busy</i> recycling and feeling good while the waste industry pursues profits, and the ultimate goals of sustainability and equity get lost in the shuffle. She demonstrates that the recycling movement itself is a big part of the problem, having never made it a priority to regulate, monitor, and focus on manufacturers' waste, and blindly embracing the consumer as the center of a 'can-do' ideology, to the neglect of troubling ecological and market realities. Drawing on her years of experience as a recycling professional, MacBride outlines bold and sensible policy recommendations for a just and sustainable recycling system and the broader materials economy. This book is a must-read for scholars, activists, and policy makers.</p>&#x2015;<b>David Naguib Pellow</b>, Don Martindale Professor of Sociology, University of Minnesota and author of <i>Garbage Wars: The Struggle for Environmental Justice in Chicago</i><br><br><p>With a thoughtful and critical eye, this study deconstructs municipal recycling, sorting the valuable aspects from those that just 'feel good' and reveals the strategic tensions that arise when a social movement, the 'zero waste' recycling movement, aligns with a business sector, the recycling industry. With a comfortable mix of technical description, financial analysis and good story telling the book challenges the simple notions of glass and plastic recycling and 'shared product responsibility'. Recognizing the important role that private enterprise can play in reuse, recycling and composting, this book concludes that good government policy remains a critical force in driving a sustainable materials economy.</p>&#x2015;<b>Ken Geiser</b>, Professor of Work Environment, Director, Lowell Center for Sustainable Production, University of Massachusetts, Lowell</p><h2>Math in Focus, Book B Grade 2: Teacher Edition (Math in Focus: Singapore Math)</h2><p>Singapore Math - Teacher&#39;s Edition</p><p></p><h2>Constitutional Law for a Changing America: Rights, Liberties, and Justice</h2><p>Known for fastidious revising and streamlining, the authors account for the latest scholarship in the field and offer rock-solid analysis of recent landmark cases, including as all the important opinions handed down through 2011.

It contains over 6,000 cross-referenced A-Z entries, and offers unrivalled coverage of all aspects of this vast and often complex subject, including theology, churches and denominations, patristic scholarship, the bible, the church calendar and its organization, popes, archbishops, saints, and mystics. <br><br>In this revision, innumerable small changes have been made to take into account shifts in scholarly opinion, recent developments, such as the Church of England's new prayer book (<em>Common Worship),</em> RC canonizations, ecumenical advances and mergers, and, where possible, statistics. A number of existing articles have been rewritten to reflect new evidence or understanding, for example the Holy Sepulchre entry, and there are a few new articles. Perhaps most significantly, a great number of the bibliographies have been updated. <br><br>Established since its first appearance in 1957 as an essential resource for ordinands, clergy, and members of religious orders, <em>ODCC</em> is an invaluable tool for academics, teachers, and students of church history and theology, as well as for the general reader. <br><br></p><p><br><strong>E.

In addition, the reader will find a host of entries pertaining to the Bible and its world. Because of the rise of theologies of liberation since the publication of the second edition, and because of a growing awareness of the need to heed Christian cultures often regarded as on the fringes of Christendom, many doctrinal articles have undergone revision and many have been added. Prominent Evangelicals have also been included (though, owing to this work's decidedly historical thrust, only rarely does the name of a living figure appear). Since the first edition, the need to involve a growing number of experts working in collaboration has been acknowledged, and those named in the editor's preface and in the list of contributors now exceeds 480. The bibliographies for many entries have been updated since the second edition. For future editions, the editors might consider using a standard Bible translation other than the Authorized Version, whose usage has declined sharply in recent decades. From a researcher's standpoint, one might also hope to see the names of contributors under each entry. Nevertheless, this is highly recommended for general libraries, especially those that serve the needs of informed lay readers or ecclesiastical researchers.?Robert H.

He effectively demonstrates that only through the interpretation of narratives can we test our capacities as persons for acknowledging the moral laws as a formula of value and for acting according to it. <br><br>Eldridge presents an extensive new interpretation of Kantian ethics that is deeply informed by Kant's aesthetics. He defends a revised version of Kantian universalism and a Kantian conception of the <i>content</i> of morality. Eldridge then turns to literature armed not with any <i>a priori </i>theory but with an interpretive stance inspired by Hegel's phenomenology of self-understanding, more or less naturalized, and by Wittgenstein's work on self-understanding as ongoing narrative-interpretive activity, a stance that yields Kantian results about the universal demands our nature places on itself. <br><br>Eldridge goes on to present readings of novels by Conrad and Austen and poetry by Wordsworth and Coleridge. In each text protagonists are seen to be struggling with moral conflicts and for self-understanding as moral persons. The route toward partial resolution of their conflicts is seen to involve multiple and ongoing activities of reading and interpreting. The result of this kind of interpretation is that such literature&#x2014;literature that portrays protagonists as themselves readers and interpreters of human capacities for morality&#x2014;is a primary source for the development of morally significant self-understanding. We see in the careers of these protagonists that there can be genuine and fruitful moral deliberation and valuable action, while also seeing how situated and partial any understanding and achievement of value must remain. <br><br><i>On Moral Personhood</i> at once delineates the moral nature of persons; shows various conditions of the ongoing, contextualized, partial acknowledgment of that nature and of the exercise of the capacities that define it; and enacts an important way of reading literature in relation to moral problems. Eldridge's work will be important reading for moral philosophers (especially those concerned with Kant, Hegel, and issues dividing moral particularists from moral universalists), literary theorists (especially those concerned with the value of literature and its relation to philosophy and to moral problems), and readers and critics of Conrad, Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Austen.</p><p><b>Richard Eldridge</b> is associate professor of philosophy at Swarthmore College.</p><h2>Paulos Milkias Dictionary of Ethiopian Christianity</h2><p>As Ethiopia celebrated its 2,000 years of Christianity and heralded the third millennium starting on September 14, 2007, Paulos Milkias' <i>Dictionary of Ethiopian Christianity</i> has emerged as an authoritative, comprehensive, and most current resource of Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo faith.

They depict a life of rich diversity; a mind of intellectual sparkle and eager curiosity; a character that relished the <em>comedie humaine</em>, and the absurdities, crotchets, and vanities of his contemporaries. The playful irony of Trevor-Roper's correspondence places him in a literary tradition stretching back to such great letter-writers as Madame de Sevigne and Horace Walpole. <br><br>Though he generally shunned emotional self-exposure in correspondence as in company, his letters to the woman who became his wife reveal the surprising intensity and the raw depths of his feelings. <br><br>Trevor-Roper was one of the most gifted scholars of his generation, and one of the most famous dons of his day. While still a young man, he made his name with his bestseller <em>The Last Days of Hitler</em>, and became notorious for his acerbic assaults on other historians. In his prime, Trevor-Roper appeared to have everything: a grey Bentley, a prestigious chair in Oxford, a beautiful country house, a wife with a title, and, eventually, a title of his own. But he failed to write the 'big book' expected of him, and tainted his reputation when in old age he erroneously authenticated the forged Hitler diaries. <br><br>For an academic, Trevor-Roper's interests were extraordinarily wide, bringing him into contact with such diverse individuals as George Orwell and Margaret Thatcher, Albert Speer and Kim Philby, Katharine Hepburn and Rupert Murdoch. The tragicomedy of his tenure as Master of Peterhouse, Cambridge, provided an appropriate finale to a career packed with incident.<br><br>Trevor-Roper's letters to Bernard Berenson, published as <em>Letters from Oxford</em> in 2006, gave pleasure to a wide variety of readers.

And who has the right to decide this ownership, particularly when the objects are sacred or, in the case of skeletal remains, human? Is it the museums that care for the objects or the communities whose ancestors made them? These questions are at the heart of <i>Plundered Skulls and Stolen Spirits</i>, an unflinching insider account by a leading curator who has spent years learning how to balance these controversial considerations.<br><br> Five decades ago, Native American leaders launched a crusade to force museums to return their sacred objects and allow them to rebury their kin. Today, hundreds of tribes use the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act to help them recover their looted heritage from museums across the country. As senior curator of anthropology at the Denver Museum of Nature &amp; Science, Chip Colwell has navigated firsthand the questions of how to weigh the religious freedom of Native Americans against the academic freedom of scientists and whether the emptying of museum shelves elevates human rights or destroys a common heritage. This book offers his personal account of the process of repatriation, following the trail of four objects as they were created, collected, and ultimately returned to their sources: a sculpture that is a living god, the scalp of a massacre victim, a ceremonial blanket, and a skeleton from a tribe considered by some to be extinct. These specific stories reveal a dramatic process that involves not merely obeying the law, but negotiating the blurry lines between identity and morality, spirituality and politics.<br><br> Things, like people, have biographies. Repatriation, Colwell argues, is a difficult but vitally important way for museums and tribes to acknowledge that fact&#x2014;and heal the wounds of the past while creating a respectful approach to caring for these rich artifacts of history.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Chip Colwell</b> is the senior curator of anthropology at the Denver Museum of Nature &amp; Science.

The message sounds loud and clear: Twenty-first century museums can indeed stand tall in addressing their own complex histories.

Journeying throughout the state, from the lush coastal forests, to the Columbia Gorge, to the golden wheat fields east of the Cascades, he encounters a cast of characters as rich and diverse as the land, including a native Tunne boy and a beautiful girl named Luce.<br><br> Originally published in 1935, <i>Honey in the Horn</i> reveals as much about the prevailing attitudes and beliefs of H. L. Davis&#x2019; lifetime as it does about the earlier era in which it is set. It transcends the limitations of its time through the sheer power and beauty of Davis&#x2019; prose. Full of humor and humanity, Davis&#x2019;s first novel displays a vast knowledge of Pacific Northwest history, lore, and landscape.<br><br> An essential book for all serious readers of Northwest literature, this classic coming-of-age novel has been called the &#x201c;<i>Huckleberry Finn</i> of the West.&#x201d; It is the only Oregon book that has ever won a Pulitzer Prize for fiction. With a new introduction by Richard W. Etulain, this important work from one of Oregon&#x2019;s premier authors is once again available for a new generation to enjoy.</p><p>H.L. Davis was a truly original Northwest voice. Born in southern Oregon&#39;s Umpqua Valley in 1894, Davis grew up in Antelope and The Dalles, USA. He began his writing career as a poet, receiving the prestigious Levinson Prize at age twenty-five. With the encouragement of H. L. Mencken-who called Honey in the Horn the best first novel ever published in America-he turned to fiction, publishing five popular novels and many short stories and essays in the course of his career."The style makes one think a little of Bret Harte, much more of Mark Twain, and in its episodes, anecdotes, and exaggerations has more than a suggestion of Paul Bunyanism&#x2014; all touched up by Mr. Davis&#x2019;s puckish hand.&#x201d;<i>&#x2014;Christian<br> Science Monitor</i><br><br>"Earth-stained, colt-wild, and uproarious!&#x201d; <i>&#x2014;The New Republic</i></p><h2>Inquiry-Based Early Learning Environments: Creating, Supporting, and Collaborating</h2><p>What does it mean to inquire? Grownups would say it means to question, to search for information, or to find out about a topic of interest. For children in an early childhood classroom, the definition is no different. From the time of their birth, children want to know how the world works and actively seek out information. How educators respond to their questions is what this book is all about. <br><br><i>Inquiry-Based Early Learning Environments</i> takes an in-depth look at children&#x2019;s inquiry. What does inquiry look like in early childhood settings? How does the environment affect children&#x2019;s inquiries and teachers&#x2019; thought processes? <i>Inquiry-Based Early Learning Environments</i> examines inquiry in all its facets, including environments that support relationships, that create a culture of risk-taking in our thinking, that support teachers as well as children, that include families, that use documentation as a way of thinking about our work, and of course, the physical environment and all the objects and spaces within it. Throughout, stories about environments and approaches to inquiry from around the world are included as examples.</p><p>Susan Stacey has worked in the field of early childhood education for over thirty-five years as an early childhood educator, director, practicum advisor, and instructor, in both Canada and the United States.

The stories were recorded from the 1960s to the present by twelve tradition bearers who where passing down for future generations the accounts of haa shuka, which means "our ancestors." Their narratives tell of the origin of social and spiritual concepts and explain the complex relationships among members of a given clan to their relatives in other clans, to spirits of the land where the vents took place, to the spirits of departed ancestors, and to the spirits of various animals, including killer whale and bear.<br><br>The focus here is on the stories and story tellers themselves, who lived amazingly different lives, reflecting in a small way the complexity of Tlingit life in the twentieth century, a period characterized by unprecedented political, economic, and social change. The stories were told in Tlingit and then transcribed from the tape recorded versions. The editors have attempted to write these stories the way they were told, and to then translate them into English keeping the unique Tlingit oral style.<br><br>This book will be of interest to the general reader of Native American literature and comparative literature, as well as to folklorists, linguists, and anthropologists.

In Healing the Split, John Nelson brings the lofty ideas of transpersonal psychology down to earth so they can be applied in a practical way to explain the bizarre effects of insanity on the human mind. Drawing on a vast knowledge of Eastern philosophy and mainstream neuropsychiatry, he heals the split between orthodox and alternative views with a comprehensive approach that goes beyond both. Starting where R. D. Laing and Thomas Szasz left off, Nelson revises and expands their radical views in light of modern brain science. He then turns to ancient tantric yoga for a synthesis that weaves brain, psyche, and spirit into a compelling new conception of mental illness.<br><br>For professionals who seek to meet the needs of their patients more creatively, this book offers a unique synthesis. For people in emotional crisis, it clarifies the distinctions among intractable psychosis, temporary breakdowns in the service of healing (spiritual emergencies), and psychic breakthroughs (spiritual emergence). And for anyone interested in the seemingly inexplicable workings of the human mind gone mad, this fascinating exploration of psychotic states of consciousness will be exciting reading.</p><p><p>John E. Nelson, M.D., is a practicing psychiatrist certified by the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology. He has worked with psychiatric patients since 1969 and has long been a student of transpersonal psychology and Eastern philosophy.</p>If California psychiatrist Nelson is correct, the hallucinated voices and visions of psychotics may lie on a continuum with the spirits and elementals known to occultists and mystics of all ages. In a challenging synthesis of transpersonal psychology, medical psychiatry and neuroscience, Nelson interprets schizophrenia, psychosis and multiple-personality disorder as altered states of consciousness involving erasure of self-boundaries and, in at least some patients, an overwhelming influx into the conscious mind of disorienting material from what Nelson calls the Spiritual Ground (equated with Brahma, Tao, The Word). Critical of the antipsychiatry movement begun by Thomas Szasz and R. D. Laing, Nelson is also dubious of theories seeking an ultimate explanation for madness in genetic abnormalities or chemical imbalances. He outlines a seven-step path of personal/spiritual growth that recognizes that madness may have roots in shocks to the fetus, the birth trauma, painful childhood experiences or dysfunctional families. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>A History of Keyboard Literature: Music for the Piano and Its Forerunners</h2><p>A History of Keyboard Literature: Music for the Piano and Its Forerunners presents a comprehensive and easily accessible history of literature for all stringed keyboard instruments.</p><p>Preface. 1.

Imagine standing underneath the mighty American Queen, largest steamboat ever built, while in drydock. Stand a midnight watch in a wheelhouse that has no wheel. Experience a man overboard drill from the rescue boat. Text contributed by some of steamboating&#39;s most noted figures like noted musician and riverman John Hartford (&#34;Gentle on My Mind&#34;), legendary Captain Clark C. &#34;Doc&#34; Hawley, and naval architect Alan Bates, designer of the &#34;Natchez&#34;. Over 100 sepia duotone photographs show the complete story of what it takes to run a steamboat.</p><p>Four-time Pulitzer nominee Jon Kral, is a senior photographer at the Miami Herald. A 31 year veteran photographer, his previous books have heralded the Cracker cowboy lifestyle in &#34;Cracker: Florida&#39;s Enduring Cowboys&#34; and shown the secret world of Thoroughbred horse racing in &#34;Hotbloods: Beyond the Winner&#39;s Circle&#34;. Kral is the winner of literally dozens of awards, including the prestigious Robert F. Kennedy Award for his coverage of youth gangs in the South. He lives in Ft. Lauderdale, FL.Over 100 sepia duotone photographs of life aboard the six extant paddlewheel steamboats plying the inland waterways of the Mississippi River system comprise this art photography book. Kral has previously authored two other photographic books, Florida's Enduring Cowboys and Hotbloods: Beyond the Winner's Circle, a 2000 PMA Benjamin Franklin Award winner, and has been a staff photographer for the Miami Herald for 16 years. The monochromatic snapshots of boat crews at work and play evoke a time apart from the present century and reveal scenes that the typical passenger never glimpses. Aside from a brief introduction, no text accompanies the photographs; evoking a particular ambiance seems to subsume the need to identify people, places, or tasks at hand. For the curious, however, an index arranged by page number and accompanied by stamp-sized reproductions of pictures from the book gives concise captions. Each of the steamboats is briefly profiled in a paragraph that details dimensions, passenger and crew allowances, and builders and owners.

In the 3rd edition of this popular volume, Keith Eubank seeks answers to the questions that have plagued us: Why, after the ghastly ordeal of World War I did Western powers undervalue the threat from Hitler? Why was there so much reluctance on the part of Britain and France to confront Germany? Why had Germany been permitted to rearm and to occupy independent nations without a struggle? What was the policy of appeasement? Why did the appeasers fail to perceive Hitler&#39;s intentions? In addition to a re-examination of these questions and an effort to dispel the enduring myths surrounding the history of this era, Keith Eubank has enhanced this new edition by including an analysis of the motivations and actions of central figures such as Neville Chamberlain and Joseph Stalin as well as a re-assessment of Soviet policies in the light of recent research that reveals their leaders as far less altruistic than some have imagined. With an expanded conclusion, a new photo section, and an updated bibliographic essay, this book remains an excellent brief overview of the period between 1918 and 1939.</p><p><p><b>Keith Eubank</b> is Professor of History Emeritus, Queens College, City University of New York.

When I ask students why they do not take full advantage of the text, their responses generally fall into two categories: </p> <ul> <li>"I cannot follow the explanations."</li> <li>"The applications are not interesting."</li> </ul> <p> I thought about both of these objections in writing every page of this book. </p> <p> <b>"I can't follow the explanations."</b> For many of my students, textbook explanations are too compressed. The chapters in <i>Algebra &amp; Trigonometry</i> have been written to make them extremely accessible. Every section contains a range of simple, intermediate, and challenging examples. Voice balloons allow for specific annotations in examples, further clarifying procedures and concepts. </p> <p> <b>"The applications are not interesting."</b> One of the things I enjoy most about teaching in a large urban community college is the diversity of who my students are and what interests them. Real-world data that celebrate this variety are used to bring relevance to examples, discussions, and applications. I selected all updated real-world data to be interesting and intriguing to students. By connecting algebra and trigonometry to the whole spectrum of their interests, it is my intent to show students that their world is profoundly mathematical and, indeed, pi is in the sky. </p> <p><b>Student Supplements</b></p> <p> <b>Student Solutions Manual (0-13-089785-X); (8978E-0).</b> Includes fully worker out solutions to most of the odd-numbered exercises in the text as well as all exercises in chapter tests and all review exercises. </p> <p> <b>MathPak Integrated Learning Environment (0-13-089384-6); (8938D-2).</b> Contains the College Algebra MathPro 4.0 along with a passcode-protected Website specifically designed to accompany this text.

The texts presented here have been selected by translator Genese Grill from Musil&#39;s Nachlass and collected for the first time under the title Thought Flights. They include material originally published in journals, newspapers, and magazines - but not included in Musil&#39;s Posthumous Papers of a Living Author - as well as literary fragments and heretofore unpublished texts. Despite the temporal, geographical, and cultural distance between Musil&#39;s world and ours, our own time and troubles are all too recognizable in Musil&#39;s portrayals of the &#34;age of money,&#34; of simulation, and of standardization. Thought Flights is a lament of contemporary complacency, optimism, and homogenization as well as a celebration of living words and original thought by one of the great Modernists of the 20th century. As an astonishing master of metaphor and self-described &#34;Monsieur le Vivisecteur,&#34; Musil explores the psyches and lives of himself and his contemporaries with illuminating insight. The lucid, striking prose of his stories and vignettes, and the wise and witty commentary of his glosses, show Musil&#39;s response to innovations in technology, art, and politics, and his efforts to enact a strategy for both illuminating and ameliorating the crisis of language that haunted his contemporaries. Moving effortlessly from discussion of fashion to Kant&#39;s categorical imperative, le vivisecteur writes with humor, lyricism, and fervor in an open genre availing itself of poetic prose, philosophical essay, fictional narrative, and feuilletonistic lightness. Through unlikely combinations and metaphoric syntheses, Musil brings &#34;beauty and excitement&#34; into the world, and when things that are usually separate unite, thoughts &#34;fly.&#34; With this publication, the now growing English-language corpus of the author of The Confusions of Young Torless, Five Women, and The Man without Qualities is expanded further. Other volumes of Musil&#39;s writings will be forthcoming from Contra Mundum Press over the next decade.</p><p>Robert Musil (1880-1942) was born in Austria. A lifelong journalist and writer, Musil was a war correspondent during World War I. He is best known for his dark, haunting, ironic and utopian prose style, showcased in his major works, The Man Without Qualities and Confusions of Young Torless.</p><h2>Identity and Leadership: Informing Our Lives, Informing Our Practice</h2><p>Identity manifests in the way we lead, supervise, make decisions, persuade, form relationships, and negotiate responsibilities each day. Student affairs professionals, who are often at the center of transformative efforts for social justice, diversity, and educational equity on college and university campuses, must understand how their own identities impact the way they interpret, work with, and lead across differences. This book offers experienced and emerging leaders a window into understanding the deep intersections of identity and professional practice as well as guideposts for individual leadership development. Through personal narratives, the contributing authors discuss the significant impact of their identities in terms of race, ethnicity, culture, sexuality, gender, socioeconomic class, nationality, disability, spirituality, and religion on their roles as higher education leaders. A model of identity, leadership, and social justice with ways of being and doing is provided and illustrated through the author narratives. The book shows how student affairs professionals can use autobiographical writing to better understand how personal identities influence interactions with students and colleagues. The book begins by introducing frameworks of identity and leadership, current research, theory, and why attention to intersections of identity and leadership is important for student affairs professionals. The second part features a collection of essays written by higher education leaders who examine how specific identities emerge in their leadership practice and how they strive to manage across differences authentically from within these identities. The book concludes with an Identity and Leadership Autobiography Assignment, which guides readers step-by-step through the process of reflecting on how their own identities and experiences impact their leadership practice. This assignment may also be used to facilitate self-reflection activities in group settings.</p><p>Alicia Fedelina Chavez is Associate Professor in Educational Leadership and Policy at the University of New Mexico.

Patton, America's premier WWll battlefield general. Both read history, prepared meticulously, and led from the front&#x2014;innovatively and instinctively. Both were confrontational. When asked what unit they had served in during the war, most members of the Third Army responded proudly and simply, 'I was with Patton.' Perhaps one day those at JPMorgan will say the same."<br> &#x2014;<strong>Wick Simmons</strong>, former CEO of Nasdaq and Prudential Securities</p> <p>"If you care about what it takes to be a successful CEO in the most complicated market ever, you will want to read The House of Dimon.

He's a leader who doesn't obsess over predicting the future but sets his organization on its toes ready to move in any direction when a problem or opportunity arises. For readers interested in real leadership, it's an action thriller. Dimon walks the talk doing the right thing even when it hurts in the short term."<br> &#x2014;<strong>William J. White</strong>, retired chairman and CEO, Bell &amp; Howell Company; Professor, Engineering and Applied Science, Northwestern University</p> <p>"Crisafulli has accomplished a major feat: gleaning the lessons-to-be-learned from the life thus far of Jamie Dimon, a man of extraordinary talent, rock-solid philosophy of life, and boundless energy, as well as capturing the essence of many of the financial industry's key personalities, explaining in layman's terms the financial instruments, environment, and events of the last two decades.

You go to a lot of businesses&#x2014;they don&#x2019;t remember how bad things can get. It takes someone who has been there. We will never forget the aftermath of the housing bubble, but 40 years from now, believe me, someone is going to forget again somewhere.&#x201d; <br><br> <b>Dealing with the Downside</b><br> &#x201c;Look where you could be wrong; admit when you&#x2019;re wrong. To me it&#x2019;s important to do that because I want everybody to do that, so that we actually make a better decision the next time.&#x201d; <br><br> <b>Buying Bear Stearns</b><br> &#x201c;We weren&#x2019;t looking to buy Bear Stearns. We wouldn&#x2019;t have bought it on its own, but we were asked to look at it. We knew the financial system was extremely delicate and Lehman [Brothers bankruptcy] helped prove that.&#x201d; <br><br> <b>The Bear Stearns Negotiations</b><br> &#x201c;The amazing story wasn&#x2019;t the financial engineering. After I got the call from [Bear Stearns CEO] Alan Schwartz, I called [JPMorgan Investment Bank co-CEOs] Steve Black and Bill Winters, and then we had 50 or 100 people get dressed and come back to work. And by 12 hours later, there were 500 and 1,000 people working on it in every department: bond trading, equity, equity derivatives, all these areas&#x2014;tax, legal, compliance, systems, ops [operations]&#x2014;everyone doing their job. And that&#x2019;s the amazing kind of thing: people acting that way&#x2014;just trying to figure it out very quickly. That really enabled us to do [the Bear Stearns deal].

If this piece of paper tells the client how much risk they&#x2019;re taking and you don&#x2019;t want to give it to them, they&#x2019;re probably taking on too much risk. Give them the paper.&#x201d; <br><br> <b>Financial Discipline</b><br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got to have disciplined reporting and a disciplined review of [what&#x2019;s] reported.

Following the eleventh-hour rescue of Bear Stearns by JPMorgan, his profile has reached stratospheric levels. And while the deals and decisions he's made have usually turned out to be the right ones, his journey to the top of the financial world has been anything but easy. <p>Now, in <i>The House of Dimon</i>, business writer Patricia Crisafulli goes behind the scenes to recount the amazing events that have shaped Dimon's career, including his rise to prominence as Sandy Weill's protï¿½gï¿½ at Citigroup, only to be fired and denied the top spot; his orchestration of the JPMorgan acquisition of BankOne, a deal that brought Dimon back to Wall Street as CEO of JPMorgan; and the drama surrounding the purchase of Bear Stearns, which helped avert a government bailout, and the strategic acquisition of Washington Mutual.</p> <p>Through interviews with Dimon, Weill, JPMorgan board members, and colleagues who've known Dimon over the course of his career, you'll gain rare access to one of today's savviest financial figures. Each step of the way, this engaging book provides insider accounts of how Dimon successfully acquired and integrated companies; reorganized underperforming units; created efficiencies; and grew bottom-line results as the consummate hands-on manager.</p> <p>Most importantly, Crisafulli places Dimon in the context of contemporary Wall Street&#x2014;an environment that has destroyed several top CEOs and led to the demise of numerous major financial institutions&#x2014;and shows you how Dimon's management style, ability to inspire outstanding performance, and talent for taking calculated risks have allowed him to excel where many others have failed.</p> <p>Jamie Dimon has flourished by avoiding alluring, but potentially catastrophic risks and taking advantage of strategic opportunities. During one of the most difficult and tumultuous periods in Wall Street history, he has survived and thrived. <i>The House of Dimon</i> reveals how he's done it and explores what lies ahead for Dimon, as he attempts to grow JPMorgan in the face of the unrelenting pressures of Wall Street.&nbsp;</p><b>Patricia Crisafulli</b> is an accomplished business writer and author who has written or ghostwritten sixteen books on business, finance, and leadership.

Music history's first virtuoso orchestral conductor, Bï¿½low created the model for the profession-both in musical brilliance and in domineering personality-which still holds forth today. He was an eminent and renowned concert pianist, a respected (and often feared) teacher and music critic, an influential editor of works by Bach, Mendelssohn, Chopin, and Beethoven, and a composer in a variety of musical genres. As a student and son-in-law of Franz Liszt, and estranged friend of Richard Wagner (for whom his wife Cosima famously left him), Bï¿½low is intricately connected with the canonical greats of the period. Yet despite his critical and lasting importance for orchestral music, Bï¿½low's life and significant achievements have yet to be heralded in biographical form. <br><br> In <em>Hans von Bï¿½low: A Life and Times</em>, Alan Walker, the acclaimed author of numerous award-winning books on the era's iconic composers, provides the first full-length English biography of this remarkable musical figure. Walker traces Bï¿½low's life in illuminating and engaging detail, from the first piano lessons of his boyhood days, to his first American tour, to his last days as conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic. Unearthing Bï¿½low's extensive and previously unavailable correspondence and writings, Walker conveys amusing and informative anecdotes about this unique musical legend- from his sardonic and clever personality to his meticulous devotion to his work-and reveals enlightening insights on the still-contested sensibilities of musical-compositional style and "idea" at play in the vibrant musical world of which Bï¿½lowwas a part.<br></p><p><br>ALAN WALKER is Professor Emeritus of Music at McMaster University, Canada. Before settling in North America he was on the staff of the Music Division of the British Broadcasting Corporation in London. He has broadcast for the BBC, for the CBC, and for CJRT - FM (Toronto), and gives regular public lectures on the music of the Romantic Era, a period in which he specializes. His thirteen published books include <em>A Study in Musical Analysis, An Anatomy of Musical Criticism</em>, and symposia on Chopin, Schumann, and Liszt. Dr. Walker is also author of a three-volume, prize winning biography of Franz Liszt, a project which took him twenty-five years to complete, and for which the President of Hungary bestowed on him the medal <em>ProCulturaHungarica</em>. The biography also received the Royal Philharmonic Society Prize, presented by HRH The Duke of Kent in London. He is the recipient of the Music Teachers National Association 2010 Achievement Award and the Knight's Cross of the Order of Merit from Hungary.<br><br>"Alan Walker's ground-breaking "Hans von Bï¿½low: A Life and Times" is the first objective biography of a major player who, for all his social ineptitude, shaped the musical world as we know it today." --<em>Wall Street Journal</em><p></p><br>"Once again Walker has accomplished the difficult task of infusing a scholarly work with witty and captivating writing. Von Bï¿½low emerges as a complex, immensely gifted and versatile musician, as well as a fascinating person. Enlightening and enjoyable!"--Veda Kaplinsky, Chair, Piano Department, The Juilliard School<p></p><br>"At a time when the study of musical performance is becoming ever more important, Alan Walker's meticulous and vivid account of one of the greatest of all 19th-century performers is of immense value. Musicologists have for so long studied works; now here is a chance to engage with one of those who brought great new works to life, from Wagner's <em>Tristan</em> to Tchaikovsky's <em>First Piano Concerto</em>, during his remarkable career. A fine, long overdue biography in English of a supreme performer."--Sir Nicholas Kenyon, Managing Director, Barbican Centre<p></p><br>"It seems that Alan Walker has left no stone unturned."--<em>Musical Opinion</em><p></p><br>"This superb biography of virtuoso pianist and conductor Hans von Bulow does for the 19th-century music scene what Alex Ross' <em>The Rest Is Noise</em> did for the 20th, leaving the reader awestruck at the author's command of his research and skillful storytelling...A treat to read." --<em>The Washington Times</em> <br><p></p><br>"Throughout the book, Walker delights the reader with rich insights and an encyclopaedic knowledge of the field, always infusing his elegant prose with a love of detail and irony, anecdotes and connections fuelled with wit and wisdom, all of which brings the subject alive. As a result his book promises to enrich scholars and music lovers alike, and to turn Beethovenians and Wagnerians into Von Bulowians: a must-read." --<em>Arietta</em><p></p><br>"Worth the wait...In English, Walker's book has no competition. Its sixty-three illustrations and programme reproductions add much to the reader's pleasure...A remarkable repository of information on Bulow." --<em>The Hungarian Quarterly</em><p></p><br>"A fascinating study of a man who intersected with all the great musicians of his day...Walker describes all of this in this engaging, well-written book. Highly recommended." --<em>Choice</em><p></p><br>"This magnificent long-overdue biography is the monument to Bï¿½low that never was...What Truman Capote did in <em>In Cold Blood</em> towards creating a new genre of fiction - faction - that is to say a documentary with all its existential drama built in, Walker has contrived to do by extension in biography - or should we call it <em>biografaction</em> - where by connecting up data in the form of letters, civic documents and newspaper reports, together with an uncanny interpretive gift for reading between the lines, he creates a vital context whereby his book, quite apart from its profundity, finishes by being as unputdownable as the latest historical novel by Mary Renault. " --<em>EPTA Piano Journal</em><p></p><br>"Von Buelow's legacy lasts to this day, and Walker takes us through his life always with the respect for who he was and what he accomplished even as he reveals his difficult and intractable personality. It is a non-judgmental and thoroughly absorbing account of one of the greatest figures in the history of western music, one who up to this book has been unappreciated and under-valued." --<em>American Music Teacher</em><p></p><br>"Walker's narrative unfolds with energy, and provides an impressively rounded portrait <br>of his subject, full of flaws as well as strengths. He explores numerous avenues and <br>leaves some open for further research--for instance Bï¿½low's compositions, little known, <br>for which the inclusion of a useful complete catalogue may, it is hoped, stimulate new <br>performances. We also learn of some lost cylinder recordings of his performances, <br>which may eventually turn up. Generously laced with witty, wise anecdotes, copious <br>footnotes, elegant illustrations and a family tree, as well as a hefty index and source list, <br>the book represents a seminal study of one of the movers and shakers of 19th-century <br>music, a relatively unsung hero of musical history." --<em>The Wagner Journal</em><p></p><br>"Walker...can only be thanked for allowing us this intimate, entertaining, and compelling portrait of a very great musician." --<em>Wagner Notes</em><p></p><br>"This book is a good read, a solid piece of writing on its own merits, as the author shares his knowledge of a fascinating life...Walker never becomes mired in details, but <br>masterfully uses footnotes that interested readers can pursue if they like. His use of illustrations is apt in the way they amplify points made in the text, rather than serve <br>any perfunctory function... <em>Hans von Bï¿½low: A Life and Times</em> is laudable for its mastery <br>of its subject, and is a work of finesse suitable to it. <em>Notes</em><p></p><br>"This study of Hans von Bï¿½low must stand as one of the most important and indeed necessary biographies of a musician published in recent times. With the lives of many nineteenth-century composers researched to the point of overkill it is right to turn to the principal executants who brought the iconic works of nineteenth-century music into the public domain. Yet Bï¿½low emerges as so much more: with his formidable musicianship supported by a well-furnished mind he represented the best (and worst) of the broad humanistic culture of the intellectual elite of late nineteenth-century Germany. Alan Walker's compelling biography more than justifies Franz Liszt's description of Bï¿½low: 'From Alpha to Omega. He is Music personified' (p. 3). " --<em>Music &amp; Letters</em><p></p><br>"This study of Hans von Bï¿½low must stand as one of the most important and indeed necessary biographies of a musician published in recent times...Compelling." --<em>Music &amp; Letters</em><p></p><br>"[An] engaging biography." --<em>The Beethoven Journal</em><p></p><br>"Walker's book can be highly recommended for its engaging style and its wealth of information about Bï¿½low's up-and-down relations with family members, Wagner, and other composers. We become familiar with the exceptional talents of a truly one-of-a-kind nineteenth-century musician." --<em>The Opera</em> <em>Journal</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Helping Children Survive Divorce</h2><p><p>How can children successfully survive the trauma of divorce? In friendly, heart-to-heart language, Archibald Hart offers divorced parents specific ways to help children cope with the psychological and social damage that comes with divorce.</p></p><p><p>Dr. Hart is a professional psychologist, a prolific writer and well-known speaker. He covers different topics including the treatment of panic attacks and depression as well as stress.</p>Helping Children Survive Divorce provides specific ways to help children cope with the psychological, social, and spiritual difficulties surrounding their parents' divorce including minimizing damage to children, common mistakes made by divorced parents, how to handle guilt, essential steps to help your child cope with depression and anger, ensuring your child's healthy post divorce development, four issues that must be dealt with in the event of remarriage, do's and don'ts for successfully building a blended family. Psychologist Archibald Hart (and the child of parents who divorced when he was 12) urges parents to recognize that "divorce is not the neutral the child will get over it quickly life event that many would have us believe". But it doesn't have to cause harsh consequences that plague children all their lives. With encouraging insights and specific steps, outlined in friendly heart-to-heart language, Helping Children Survive Divorce is essential reading for divorcing parents. -- <i>Midwest Book Review</i></p><h2>A Gardener&#39;s Guide to Florida&#39;s Native Plants</h2><p>Abundantly illustrated in full color, this guide provides detailed descriptions and methods of cultivation for 350 of Florida&#39;s most attractive and easily grown native plants, including ferns, wildflowers, shrubs, trees, vines, aquatics, and epiphytes (air plants).

The empire Marketing Board was established in 1926 in order to encourage the British public to buy Empire products, and thereby to foster closer imperial economic relations. Prominent in its activities was the poster campaign directed by Frank Pick, whose better-known work for London Underground is shown in this new study to be matched by his efforts for the Empire Marketing Board. A selection of 60 designs, reproduced in full colour from the Public Record Office&#39;s extensive collection features the contrasting styles of McKnight Kauffer, Clive Gardiner, Frank Newbould, Austin Cooper and other leading poster artists of the day. Some pictures re models of graphic design while others convey vivid impressions of the Empire at home and overseas. Stephen Constantine&#39;s lively text puts the Board, the posters and the artists themselves into a socio-historical perspective, demonstrating not only the continued importance of the Empire to inter-war British governments, but also an official recognition of the persuasive power of modern advertising techniques.</p><p></p><h2>He Said, She Said</h2><p><p>Sparks will fly in this hip-hop-hot teen novel that mixes social protest and star-crossed romance, from Newbery Medal and Coretta Scott King Honor&#x2013;winning author Kwame Alexander! <em>He Said, She Said</em> is perfect for fans of Walter Dean Myers and Rachel Vail alike.

Based on thousands of previously unavailable documents, Andrew Lycett, author of the critically acclaimed biography Dylan Thomas, offers the first definitive biography of the baffling Conan Doyle, finally making sense of a long-standing mystery: how the scientifically minded creator of the world's most rational detective himself succumbed to an avid belief in spiritualism, including communication with the dead.<p>Conan Doyle was a man of many contradictions. Always romantic, energetic, idealistic and upstanding, he could also be selfish and fool-hardy. Lycett assembles the many threads of Conan Doyle's life, including the lasting impact of his domineering mother and his wayward, alcoholic father; his affair with a younger woman while his wife lay dying; and his nearly fanatical pursuit of scientific data to prove and explain various supernatural phenomena. Lycett reveals the evolution of Conan Doyle's nature and ideas against the backdrop of his intense personal life, wider society and the intellectual ferment of his age. In response to the dramatic scientific and social transformations at the turn of the century, he rejected traditional religious faith in favor of psychics and sï¿½ances -- and in this way he embodied all of his late-Victorian, early-Edwardian era's ambivalence about the advance of science and the decline of religion. </p><p>The first biographer to gain access to Conan Doyle's newly released personal archive -- which includes correspondence, diaries, original manuscripts and more -- Lycett combines assiduous research with penetrating insight to offer the most comprehensive, lucid and sympathetic portrait yet of Conan Doyle's personal journey from student to doctor, from world-famous author to ardent spiritualist.</p></p><p><b>Andrew Lycett</b> studied history at Oxford University. After an early career as a foreign correspondent specializing in Africa and the Middle East, he now writes biographies. His lives of Dylan Thomas, Rudyard Kipling and Ian Fleming have been highly praised.<p>One</p><p><b>Two Irish Families</b></p><p>Molten lava and packed ice: even the natural forces that created Edinburgh's jagged landscape came in contrasting pairs. More than 300 million years ago one of the smouldering volcanoes that dotted the surrounding countryside erupted, making a series of crags, the tallest of which, serendipitously known as Arthur's Seat, now towers over the city. Later, vast glaciers ground their way through the lava-rich earth, shaping these contours and forming deep basins where today railways run instead of dinosaurs.</p><p>This was the ribbon of soaring pinnacles and perpendicular drops that Robert Louis Stevenson fondly recalled as his "precipitous city." For the full vertiginous effect, he probably also envisaged the steepling, overcrowded tenements or "lands" that spread upwards over what little space the cramped "crag and tail" topographical features permitted, so creating the high-rise skyline of Edinburgh's Old Town.</p><p>At ground level, a network of alleys or "wynds" led off the main Royal Mile. By the mid-eighteenth century, the stench, squalor and sheer numbers had become so insufferable that the professional classes leading the pragmatic intellectual movement known as the Scottish Enlightenment wanted somewhere more salubrious to live. After deciding on a solid sandstone ridge a mile away, they drained and bridged Nor'Loch, the inland lake that lay between, and hired a young architect, James Craig, to design a well ordered New Town, full of classical terraces and leafy squares.</p><p>As with the Old and New Town, so with Edinburgh in general. It is a city of dramatic contrasts, made tolerable by thoughtful accommodation. Here the ferocity of the outlying Highlands and Lowlands was blunted by the civilizing achievements of the Athens of the North. Here a Scottish fascination with witchcraft and the supernatural came under the skeptical gaze of scholars such as David Hume who congregated at the university. With his home city in mind, Stevenson wrote his classic fictional portrayal of schizophrenia, <i>The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</i>, drawing on Edinburgh's real-life Deacon Brodie -- respectable shopkeeper by day, infamous body theif by night. The only thing that remained constant was the bitter cold.</p><p>Arthur Conan Doyle was born at a slight tangent to this polarized world in Picardy Place, a quiet enclave off the main road out of town to Leith. Taking its name from the colony of linen-weavers who came there from France in 1729 to start a local industry, it played host to newer arrivals such as Arthur's parents, whose families hailed from Ireland and who enjoyed the security of living across the way from their co-religionists in the Roman Catholic church of St. Mary's.</p><p>Arthur himself came into the world early on May 22, 1859. His horoscope later put the exact time as 4:55 a.m., confirming that, in astrological terms, he was a Gemini, born under the sign of the twins, which was doubly appropriate, given the contrary nature of the city and his own future as a figure whose lifelong struggle to find some middle ground between the opposing nineteenth-century forces of spirituality and reason would provide such a fascinating commentary on his times.</p><p>In "The Adventure of the Greek Interpreter," Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson discuss the hoary question of "nature versus nurture." When Watson attributes his colleague's remarkable powers of observation and deduction to his "early systematic training," the detective agrees, but only up to a point, arguing that the real reason lies in his veins. Although his family were mainly country squires, "who appear to have led much the same life as is natural to their class," Holmes believes his special skills come from the artistic genes he inherited from his grandmother, a sister of the real-life French painter Horace Vernet. And "art in the blood is liable to take the strangest forms."</p><p>So it was with Arthur himself. His family was a source of pride and inspiration, particularly to a dï¿½classï¿½ Celt anxious to position himself securely in socially stratified Anglo-centric society. But there were skeletons in the cupboard that were worrying to a scientist schooled in murky Victorian concepts of heredity.</p><p>Both sides of his family came from Ireland. But lineages are often hazy there, since so many records were lost in the civil war. At one stage Arthur was so convinced the Doyles were descended from Dubgall, King of Ulster, that he had a stained-glass window built at Undershaw, his house in Hindhead, showing several putative crests, including the Red Hand of Ulster. In fact, his surname meant little more than "dark stranger" or "foreigner," a reference to the king's Viking origins. He later dropped this idea and settled for the Doyles being a cadet branch of the Staffordshire family of that name who went to Ireland with the English invasion and spawned a large clan in County Wexford.</p><p>So far as the record extends, Arthur's grandfather John Doyle was a tailor's son who started professional life as an equestrian artist in Georgian Dublin. He won commissions from aristocratic patrons, including Lord Talbot, Lord Lieutenant during a politically turbulent period from 1817 to 1821, and the Second Marquess of Sligo.</p><p>One thing is indisputable -- the Doyles were devout Roman Catholics. Both John Doyle's sisters became nuns, and his brother James trained as a priest. As the Catholic journal The Month noted, John was the only child of the family who remained "in the world," and with this situation came a certain austerity -- a character trait emphasized by his height, bearing and angular patrician features. But his daunting demeanor was offset by a good nature and gentle Irish sense of humor.</p><p>In 1820 he married Marianna Conan, whose father also worked as a tailor in the Dublin rag trade. Again her antecedents are blurred, purportedly stretching back to the ancient ducal house of Britanny. Within a short time she had borne him a daughter, Annette. The start of a family was a signal for John Doyle to think seriously about his career. Following the Union of Great Britain and Ireland, educated Irishmen of his type began to look to London as a cultural as well as political capital. At the same time Irish Catholics were making inroads into the discriminatory legislation that barred them from political office.</p><p>Ambitious and pragmatic, Doyle made the logical move to London where, with his wife and infant child, he rented a house in an artists' enclave in Berners Street, north of Oxford Street. As mementos and statements of intent, he took some heirlooms with him. According to family tradition, these included silverware, engraved with the Doyle crest and motto "Patientia Vincit" (he conquers through patience); a pestle and mortar; and a portrait, supposedly by van Dyck, of Thomas Wentworth, First Earl of Strafford. This was an odd choice since Strafford, in the early seventeenth century, had been a leading perpetrator of the despoliation of the Catholic landed gentry, which had cost the Doyles their estates. While suggesting that John bore few grudges, it also pointed to the type of commission he hoped to obtain from high-born patrons.</p><p>Initially business was slow, and John was forced to move several times with his growing family, spending two years south of the river Thames in Lambeth. A change of artistic direction came after he visited the House of Commons. He found that his combination of wit and draftsmanship was well suited to producing caricatures of the participants in the mother of Parliaments. Making good use of modern techniques of lithography, he began in 1827 to publish a regular series of political sketches, which he signed with the initials HB, a composite representation of his initials. With obsessive secrecy, he managed for sixteen years to keep his identity secret. During that period his sarcastic, well observed and usually benevolent cartoons of Britain's political elite provided a graphic bridge between the angry Regency satires of Gillray and Cruikshank and the more respectful High Victorian output of Leech and Tenniel.</p><p>John was soon earning a comfortable living, enough to move in 1833 to a large, new house at 17 Cambridge Terrace (now Sussex Gardens), north of Hyde Park. By then Marianna had produced seven children, all of whom showed varying degrees of artistic talent. His daughter Annette was a gifted musician, and a pious one, who later became a nun. James, born in 1822, was a scholarly youth, whose adoption of his father's more severe traits earned him the nickname "the Priest." Fascinated by the past, he would make a name illustrating and writing about history. Richard, or Dicky, born in 1824, was the most naturally gifted, and would follow "HB" in a successful career, principally as an illustrator. Henry, born in 1827, was also a promising cartoonist, before later finding his mï¿½tier as an arts curator. Then there were Francis and Adelaide, who both died young without making a mark, and, finally, on March 25, 1832, came Arthur's father, Charles Altamont, his second name a nod to HB's early patron, the Marquess of Sligo, who held the subsidiary title Earl of Altamont.</p><p>The atmosphere at Cambridge Terrace was politically and culturally conservative, as might be expected from an Irish Roman Catholic family making its way in late Georgian society. The children were taught at home, since John was skeptical about English education. As was evident from his choice of the French Chapel off Baker Street as his place of worship, he was Francophile in matters of mind and spirit -- a throwback perhaps to his wife's French origins. His son Henry spent a short period at a Jesuit school in the Marylebone Road but, otherwise, the Doyle boys and girls grew up with their own private tutor, Mr. Street, whose services were supplemented by both a fencing and a dancing master. As part of this privileged upbringing, they were expected to devise their own entertainments, centered around a play or a concert every Sunday. With an artist as father, they were also encouraged to go out and observe the world.

Think of the Buddha, Chuang Tzu, or Marcus Aurelius: stoically composed figures impervious to the torments of the wider world, living their lives in complete serenity&#x2014;and teaching us how to do the same. After all, isn&#x2019;t a life free from suffering the ideal? Isn&#x2019;t it what so many of us seek? Absolutely not, argues Todd May in this provocative but compassionate book. In a moving examination of life and the trials that beset it, he shows that our fragility, our ability to suffer, is actually one of the most important aspects of our humanity.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> May starts with a simple but hard truth: suffering is inevitable. At the most basic level, we suffer physically&#x2014;a sprained ankle or a bad back. But we also suffer insults and indifference. We suffer from overburdened schedules and unforeseen circumstances, from moral dilemmas and emotional heartaches. Even just thinking about our own mortality&#x2014;the fact that we only live one life&#x2014;can lead us to tremendous suffering. No wonder philosophies such as Buddhism, Taosim, Stoicism, and even Epicureanism&#x2014;all of which counsel us to rise above these plights&#x2014;have had appeal over the centuries. May highlights the tremendous value of these philosophies and the ways they can guide us toward better lives, but he also exposes a major drawback to their tenets: such invulnerability is too emotionally disengaged from the world, leading us to place too great a distance between ourselves and our experience. Rather than seeking absolute immunity, he argues most of us just want to hurt less and learn how to embrace and accept what suffering we do endure in a meaningful way.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Offering a guide on how to positively engage suffering, May ultimately lays out a new way of thinking about how we exist in the world, one that reassures us that our suffering, rather than a failure of physical or psychological resilience, is a powerful and essential part of life itself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Todd May </b>is the Class of 1941 Memorial Professor of philosophy at Clemson University. He is the author of many books, including <i>A Significant Life</i>, also published by the University of Chicago Press.<br> &nbsp;"His discussion of the ways in which those who try to make themselves invulnerable &#x2014; especially in the face of Large Matters &#x2014; undermine what makes us most human, is clear&nbsp;and bracing. Importantly, May underscores that it is not that we wish to grieve, or be saddened, by the death of a loved one. Instead, 'each of us wants to be the&nbsp;<i>kind of person</i>&nbsp;[May&#x2019;s italics] who can suffer at certain misfortunes. Being able to suffer in the case of Large Matters is an expression not only of who we are but of who we want to be.'" (<i>Los Angeles Review of Books</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Very few books have struck this reviewer as both poetic and so very real at the same moment. May&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>A Fragile Life</i>&nbsp;does exactly that.&nbsp;It is not scientific and it is not &#x2018;new age.&#x2019;&nbsp;It is a deeply felt and touchingly presented view of how to be human&#x2014;and live with that! If the reader can accept May&#x2019;s starting premise&#x2014;that all human beings suffer&#x2014;then the rest will be easy to digest.&nbsp;Does one want to choose to linger in that suffering or accept it as an unavoidable part of a life worth living? If one chooses the latter, May offers encouragement and guidance on how to do this&#x2014;one day at time. Most (if not all) 12-step programs suggest living by this motto, but few authors have found a way to make this practice applicable to the lives of all.&nbsp;May makes this work.&nbsp;It is not about avoiding suffering or pretending bad things have not happened.&nbsp;May shows the reader how to accept that vulnerability and be strong in spite of it.&nbsp;This text is strongly recommended for all readers who happen to be human! Highly recommended.&#x201d; (<i>Choice</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Would that all academics wrote as clearly as Todd May! He&#x2019;s a real teacher, who proves that much, if not all, of what&#x2019;s expressed in abstruse prose can be said in a manner that any attentive mind can readily understand. <i>A Fragile Life</i> is a clear and honest exploration, illustrated by helpful stories, of how we should think about our vulnerability to suffering. It will appeal to anyone who&#x2019;s interested in how philosophy can illuminate and guide our lives.&#x201d; (<i>Scott Samuelson, author of The Deepest Human Life</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;With an astonishing capacity to travel across philosophical traditions and with his usual grace in rendering deep philosophical issues through an accessible language, May tackles here one of the most pressing existential questions of our time: are we vulnerable, and, if so, why? This is a must read for anybody who has ever asked herself &#x2018;What am I doing here?&#x2019;&#x201d; (<i>Chiara Bottici, author of Imaginal Politics: Images Beyond Imagination and the Imaginary</i>)</p><h2>The Selected Stories of Patricia Highsmith</h2><p><p><strong><em>The Selected Stories of Patricia Highsmith</em> presents five of Highsmith's classic short story collections in a single masterful volume. Compelling, twisted, and fiercely intelligent, this landmark collection showcases Highsmith's mastery of the short story form.</strong></p> In a cruel twist of irony, Texas-born Patricia Highsmith (1921-1995) is being recognized only after her death for her inestimable genius in her native land. With the savage humor of Waugh and the macabre sensibility of Poe, she brought a distinctly contemporary acuteness to her prolific body of noir fiction. Including over 60 short stories written throughout her career, collected together for the first time, <em>The Selected Stories</em> reveals the stunning versatility and terrifying power of Highsmith's work.<br><br> These stories highlight the remarkable range of Highsmith's powers her unique ability to quickly, almost imperceptibly, draw out the mystery and strangeness of her subject, which appears achingly ordinary to our naked eye. Whether writing about jaded wives or household pets, Highsmith continually upsets our expectations and presents a world frighteningly familiar to our own, where danger lurks around every turn.

Her world remains all the more frightening because we recognize it as our own.</p><p><b>Penzler Pick, September 2001:</b> One of the truly brilliant short-story writers of the 20th century, Patricia Highsmith has at last received the acclaim she never had while alive.<p> The release of the excellent film <i>The Talented Mr. Ripley</i> appears to have brought Highsmith many readers who may have heard of her but had never read her books. In spite of the fame of <i>Strangers on a Train</i>, published when she was still in her 20s, Highsmith never enjoyed commercial success in the United States (though she was a huge bestseller in Germany and Austria).</p><p> Now, six years after her death at the age of 74, Norton is reissuing her novels and has compiled this giant collection of her short fiction, incorporating the complete text of five previously published collections. This volume also includes an introduction by Graham Greene, somewhat truncated from its original (and uncredited) publication in <i>The Snail-Watcher and Other Stories</i> (1970). It is abbreviated because, oddly, none of the stories from that excellent collection are included in the present omnibus, and Greene makes reference to what is perhaps Highsmith's most famous story, "The Snail- Watcher."</p><p> Even lacking this masterpiece and the equally unsettling "The Terrapin," there are many distinguished tales of horror and, as Greene accurately defines them, apprehension.</p><p> In "The Hand," the first story in the collection originally published as <i>Little Tales of Misogyny</i>, a young man asks the father of his beloved for her hand and is given it--in a box. Equally unappealing events befall the women (and, indeed, the men) skewered in the other stories in this aptly titled volume, most of which are so short that they are mere vignettes, each startling in the terse clarity of the prose and the matter-of-factness of the fates meted out to the protagonists. </p><p> "The Dancer" is strangled in quiet rage by her partner, who walks away from her lifeless body as an audience cheers the performance. "The Coquette" is murdered by the two lovers she had set against each other, and they are let off by a judge who had also been tortured by her coquetry. He forgave their infatuation with her, "a state that inspired his pity, since he had become sixty years old," as Highsmith cruelly explains.</p><p> "The Black House," the title story of another collection, introduces a pleasant, happy, and charming young man who is, of course, doomed. He tests his courage by entering a dark house, reputedly haunted and the scene of young lovers' trysts as well as the vicious murder of a boy, and finds it empty and unthreatening. When he describes his adventure to his friends at the local pub, he is killed for a transgression that remains unknown to him. </p><p> This important book may not be for everyone, but if you don't mind a sense of unrelenting doom and are willing to risk nightmares of dread, you will find the prose dazzling and the fiction memorable. <i>--Otto Penzler</i></p>Compelling, twisted and fiercely intelligent, <i>The Selected Stories of Patricia Highsmith</i> is a landmark collection, showcasing her mastery of the short story form. <p>In a cruel twist of irony, Texas-born Patricia Highsmith (1921-1995) is being recognized only after her death for her inestimable genius in her native land. With the savage humor of Waugh and the macabre sensibility of Poe, she brought a distinctly contemporary acuteness to her prolific body of noir fiction. Including over 60 short stories written throughout her career, collected together for the first time, <i>The Selected Stories</i> reveals the stunning versatility and terrifying power of Highsmith's work. </p><p>Thirty years before David Lynch's <i>Blue Velvet</i>, Highsmith's novels and stories shattered the cool veneer of idyllic American suburbia. Living in self-imposed exile in Switzerland and France for most of her life, Highsmith, from this far-off vantage point, felt the freedom to express her uniquely haunting literary imagination. Already an accomplished novelist, Highsmith came to use the short story form in the mid-1970s, in particular to showcase her talents for brevity, jolting irony, and a voracious control of her craft. Here, in <i>The Selected Stories</i>, her phrases sting and their impact lingers in our minds. These stories highlight the remarkable range of Highsmith's powers&#x2014;her unique ability to quickly, almost imperceptibly, draw out the mystery and strangeness of her subject, which appears achingly ordinary to our naked eye. </p><p>Whether writing about jaded wives or household pets, Highsmith continually upsets our expectations and presents a world frighteningly familiar to our own, where danger lurks around every turn. Stories from <i>The Animal-Lovers Book of Beastly Murders</i> portray, with incisive humor, the murderously competitive desires of our most trusted companions. In this viciously satirical reprise of Kafka, cats, dogs, and cockroaches are no longer necessary aspects of a happy home but actually have the power to destroy it.

The notebooks are a precious resource for those wishing to cook Lao food: the 124 recipes were compiled to give a balanced view of the cuisine (albeit from quite a high-ranking perspective). In the thirty years since its first appearance, materials and ingredients have become easier to source, and the cooking techniques and styles more familiar to us. The dishes, therefore, are very cookable. There is a long prefatory section, written by the late Alan Davidson and his daughter Jennifer, which explains much about Lao cookery, ingredients and equipment. The whole book is plentifully illustrated with drawings done from life by Soun Vannithone and other Lao artists. The introduction is 50 pages long and covers the life of Phia Sing; Lao eating habits and attitudes to food; Lao culinary terms and culinary equipment; and Lao ingredients.</p><p>Phia Sing (d. 1967) was Master of Ceremonies and Chef at the Royal Palace of Luang Prabang.Text: English, Lao</p><h2>Solutions to Black Exercises for Chemistry: The Central Science</h2><p>Solutions to Black Exercises for Chemistry</p><p></p><h2>The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars: Dispatches from the Front Lines</h2><p>The ongoing assault on climate science in the United States has never been more aggressive, more blatant, or more widely publicized than in the case of the Hockey Stick graph&#x2015;a clear and compelling visual presentation of scientific data, put together by MichaelE. Mann and his colleagues, demonstrating that global temperatures have risen in conjunction with the increase in industrialization and the use of fossil fuels. Here was an easy-to-understand graph that, in a glance, posed a threat to major corporate energy interests and those who do their political bidding. The stakes were simply too high to ignore the Hockey Stick&#x2015;and so began a relentless attack on a body of science and on the investigators whose work formed its scientific basis.<br><br>The Hockey Stick achieved prominence in a 2001 UN report on climate change and quickly became a central icon in the "climate wars." The real issue has never been the graph's data but rather its implied threat to those who oppose governmental regulation and other restraints to protect the environment and planet. Mann, lead author of the original paper in which the Hockey Stick first appeared, shares the story of the science and politics behind this controversy. He reveals key figures in the oil and energy industries and the media frontgroups who do their bidding in sometimes slick, sometimes bare-knuckled ways. Mann concludes with the real story of the 2009 "Climategate" scandal, in which climate scientists' emails were hacked. This is essential reading for all who care about our planet's health and our own well-being.</p><p><p>A riveting exposï¿½ that cuts through the fog of disinformation and deceit generated by the campaign to deny the reality of global climate change.</p><p>Honorable Mention - 2013 Green Book Festival in the Scientific category</p></p><h2>Frank Lloyd Wright Collected Writings, Vol. 1: 1894-1930</h2><p>The first volume of a collection assembled by the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation begins with the young architect&#39;s previously unpublished lectures on his basic philosophy of architecture, and ends with his famed &#34;Kahn Lectures&#34; given at Princeton University.

It may come as a surprise to inexperienced gardeners but the creation and care of bonsai is a comparatively simple art which can actually be systematically taught rather than, as in earlier books on the subject, just talked about vaguely. Now, given a reasonably green thumb and a modicum of patience, anyone in any country can create his own bonsai.<br><br><i>The Japanese art of Miniature Trees and Landscapes</i> contains detailed instructions, together with many helpful diagrams and charts and a treasury of photographs, on every phase of the art: propagation and training, with hints for those in a hurry and for small-apartment dwellers; daily and seasonal care, and treatment of pests; how to judge, select, and exhibit bonsai, with emphasis always upon the untold enjoyment they can provide.

One of Cather's earliest novels, written in 1918, it is the story of ï¿½ntonia Shimerda, who arrives on the Nebraska frontier as part of a family of Bohemian emigrants. Her story is told through the eyes of Jim Burden, a neighbor who will befriend ï¿½ntonia, teach her English, and follow the remarkable story of her life.<br>Working in the fields of waving grass and tall corn that dot the Great Plains, ï¿½ntonia forges the durable spirit that will carry her through the challenges she faces when she moves to the city. But only when she returns to the prairie does she recover her strength and regain a sense of purpose in life. In the quiet, probing depth of Willa Cather's art, ï¿½ntonia's story becomes a mobbing elegy to those whose persistence and strength helped build the American frontier.</p></p><p>It seems almost sacrilege to infringe upon a book as soulful and rich as Willa Cather's <i>My ï¿½ntonia</i> by offering comment. First published in 1918, and set in Nebraska in the late 19th century, this tale of the spirited daughter of a Bohemian immigrant family planning to farm on the untamed land ("not a country at all but the material out of which countries are made") comes to us through the romantic eyes of Jim Burden. He is, at the time of their meeting, newly orphaned and arriving at his grandparents' neighboring farm on the same night her family strikes out to make good in their new country. Jim chooses the opening words of his recollections deliberately: "I first heard of ï¿½ntonia on what seemed to be an interminable journey across the great midland plain of North America," and it seems almost certain that readers of Cather's masterpiece will just as easily pinpoint the first time they heard of ï¿½ntonia and her world. It seems equally certain that they, too, will remember that moment as one of great light in an otherwise unremarkable trip through the world. <p> ï¿½ntonia, who, even as a grown woman somewhat downtrodden by circumstance and hard work, "had not lost the fire of life," lies at the center of almost every human condition that Cather's novel effortlessly untangles. She represents immigrant struggles with a foreign land and tongue, the restraints on women of the time (with which Cather was very much concerned), the more general desires for love, family, and companionship, and the great capacity for forbearance that marked the earliest settlers on the frontier.</p> <p> As if all this humanity weren't enough, Cather paints her descriptions of the vastness of nature--the high, red grass, the road that "ran about like a wild thing," the endless wind on the plains--with strokes so vivid as to make us feel in our bones that we've just come in from a walk on that very terrain ourselves. As the story progresses, Jim goes off to the University in Lincoln to study Latin (later moving on to Harvard and eventually staying put on the East Coast in another neat encompassing of a stage in America's development) and learns Virgil's phrase "<i>Optima dies ... prima fugit</i>" that Cather uses as the novel's epigraph. "The best days are the first to flee"--this could be said equally of childhood and the earliest hours of this country in which the open land, much like <i>My ï¿½ntonia</i>, was nothing short of a rhapsody in prairie sky blue. <i>--Melanie Rehak</i></p>"The best thing I've done is <i>My Antonia</i>," recalled Willa Cather. "I feel I've made a contribution to American letters with that book." <p> An unconventional novel of prairie life, <i>My Antonia</i> tells the story of a remarkable woman whose strength and passion epitomize the pioneer spirit. Antonia Shimerda returns to Black Hawk, Nebraska, to made a fresh start after eloping with a railway conductor following the tragic death of her father. Accustomed to living in a sod house and toiling alongside the men in the fields, she is unprepared for the lecherous reaction her lush sensuality provokes when she moves to the city. Despite betrayal and crushing opposition, Antonia steadfastly pursues her quest for happiness--a moving struggle that mirrors the quiet drama of the American landscape.</p> <p></p> <p> "No romantic novel ever written in America, by man or woman, is one half so beautiful as <i>My Antonia</i>."--H.L. Mencken</p></p><h2>The Blessings of Liberty: A Concise History of the Constitution of the United States</h2><p>This concise, accessible text provides students with a history of American constitutional development in the context of political, economic, and social change. Constitutional historian Michael Benedict stresses the role that the American people have played over time in defining the powers of government and the rights of individuals and minorities. He covers important trends and events in U.S. constitutional history, encompassing key Supreme Court and lower-court cases. The volume begins by discussing the English and colonial origins of American constitutionalism. Following an analysis of the American Revolution&#39;s meaning to constitutional history, the text traces the Constitution&#39;s evolution from the Early Republic to the present day. This third edition is updated to include the election of 2000, the Tea Party and the rise of popular constitutionalism, and the rise of judicial supremacy as seen in cases such as Citizens United, the Affordable Care Act, and gay marriage.</p><p>Michael Les Benedict is a prominent American historian who taught at Ohio State University from 1970 until his retirement in 2005."The third edition of Michael Les Benedict&#x2019;s The Blessings of Liberty is a treasure. Clearly written and easy to understand, the text takes us from the English roots of American constitutionalism to 2016. Taking the approach of the modern constitutional historian, Benedict plunges us into the controversies relevant to the formation and implementation of the Constitution of 1787 and its amendments, providing the necessary political, social, and economic context that accompanied the development of American constitutional law. I wish there were more undergraduate courses in constitutional history, so that more students could read this book. But we could all benefit by reading it." (Maeva Marcus, Director, Institute for Constitutional History, The New-York Historical Society and The George Washington University Law School)<br><br>"There is no better introduction to constitutional history than The Blessings of Liberty. Learned, clearly written, up to date on recent scholarship, the book is essential reading for anyone seeking to understand this crucial subject." (Eric Foner, Columbia University)<br><br>"I am astounded by Les Benedict&#x2019;s ability to compress the story of American constitutional development&#x2014;which he rightly treats as requiring far more than simply knowledge of Supreme Court decisions&#x2014;into a relatively short and readable volume (that, in addition, contains extremely helpful bibliographies).

We follow Chicago workers as they make choices about whether to attend ethnic benefit society meetings or to go to the movies, whether to shop in local neighborhood stores or patronize the new A &amp; P. Although workers may not have been political in traditional terms during the '20s, as they made daily decisions like these, they declared their loyalty in ways that would ultimately have political significance. As the depression worsened in the 1930s, not only did workers find their pay and working hours cut or eliminated, but the survival strategies they had developed during the 1920s were undermined. Looking elsewhere for help, workers adopted new ideological perspectives and overcame longstanding divisions among themselves to mount new kinds of collective action. Chicago workers' experiences as citizens, ethnics and blacks, wage earners and consumers all converged to make them into New Deal Democrats and CIO unionists.</p><p>The lives of Chicago workers are traced in the mid thirties to reveal how their experiences as citizens, members of ethnic or racial groups, wage earners and consumers, converged to transform them into New Deal Democrats and CIO unionists.Lizabeth Cohen is the Howard Mumford Jones Professor of American Studies in the History Department of Harvard University.

What commentators miss, however, is that increasing polarization in recent decades has been closely accompanied by fundamental social and economic changes--most notably, a parallel rise in income inequality. In <i>Polarized America</i>, Nolan McCarty, Keith Poole, and Howard Rosenthal examine the relationships of polarization, wealth disparity, immigration, and other forces, characterizing it as a dance of give and take and back and forth causality.Using NOMINATE (a quantitative procedure that, like interest group ratings, scores politicians on the basis of their roll call voting records) to measure polarization in Congress and public opinion, census data and Federal Election Commission finance records to measure polarization among the public, the authors find that polarization and income inequality fell in tandem from 1913 to 1957 and rose together dramatically from 1977 on; they trace a parallel rise in immigration beginning in the 1970s. They show that Republicans have moved right, away from redistributive policies that would reduce income inequality. Immigration, meanwhile, has facilitated the move to the right: non-citizens, a larger share of the population and disproportionately poor, cannot vote; thus there is less political pressure from the bottom for redistribution than there is from the top against it. In "the choreography of American politics" inequality feeds directly into political polarization, and polarization in turn creates policies that further increase inequality.</p></p><p><p>Howard Rosenthal is Professor of Politics at New York University and Visiting Scholar at the Russell Sage Foundation.</p><p>A breath of fresh air....

Rather, it is people who shape their culture by constantly manipulating conventional symbols taken from a variety of everchanging codes to create new meanings. Wagner sees culture arising from the dialectic between the individual and the social world; his analysis is situated in the relation between invention and convention, innovation and control, meaning and context. Finally, the author points out that the symbolization processes that generate the construction of meaning in culture are the same as those that anthropologists use to "invent" the cultures they study.<br></p><p><strong>Roy Wagner</strong> is professor of anthropology at the University of Virginia. <strong>Tim Ingold</strong> is chair of social anthropology at the University of Aberdeen.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>The Global West: Connections &amp; Identities, Volume 2: Since 1550</h2><p>Intimidated by the thought of taking Western civ?

It's hardly surprising, then, that if there are any villains in his account of his vice-presidency, they're Sam Donaldson; various minions of the <i>New York Times</i> and <i>Washington Post</i>; sometimes--but not always--Dan Rather; the gadfly conservative magazine, the <i>American Spectator</i>; and even a supposed friend, George Will. But Quayle nurses no grudges with journalists (indeed, he seems most put out with the political handlers assigned to him in 1988 and the 1992 campaign team led by James Baker). He just wants reporters to be candid about their political biases and to show some generosity of spirit. The latter he finds especially lacking in liberals in general, except for--which may surprise many--Ted Kennedy and Bill Clinton, both of whom, Quayle says, are great guys. Not that he shares much of anything politically with them; he is the staunch conservative throughout this memoir, and he also periodically asserts the influence of his Christian faith upon his thoughts and actions. What he most signally accomplishes is to show what he did during his vice-presidency, feats that included much international diplomacy and, most impressively, handling, in the absence of President Bush (en route to the Malta summit with Gorbachev), the crisis of the most serious coup against Philippine president Cory Aquino. This thoughtful book is probably the best thing ever written about the modern vice-presidency. <i>Ray Olson</i>For those convinced that Richard Nixon was finished politically in the early 1960s, that Ronald Reagan was too old and extreme for the White House even in the 1970s, and that Quayle is too mediocre, dangerous, and dumb for the Oval Office, this book serves as an antidote. It's one-part autobiography, one-part "I was there-a heartbeat away," and one-part potential presidential platform. As an autobiography, it offers new information on Quayle's life and background; as an insight into the vice presidency, it serves as a necessary counterweight to the media assault against him; as a platform, it presents a conservative who might mediate those on either side of him as well as deal with the Democrats. By revealing his positive and negative aspects, Quayle comes across as a serious, insightful politician. Building on Richard Fenno's Making of a Senator (Congressional Quarterly, 1989) and David S. Broder and Bob Woodward's The Man Who Would Be President-Dan Quayle (LJ 5/15/92), the book is an intelligent, readable, and shrewd view of Quayle's past and possible future.<br><i>--William D.

R W Chapman's ground-breaking edition of the <em>Letters</em> first appeared in 1932, and a second edition followed twenty years later. For this third edition Le Faye has added new material that has come to light since 1952, and reordered the letters into their correct chronological sequence. She has provided new biographical, topographical and general indexes, discreet annotation, and information on watermarks, postmarks and other physical details of the manuscripts. The edition has also been redesigned for ease of reading and reference.</p><p>Jane Austen famously labeled her literary ambit a "little bit (two inches wide) of ivory." Luckily, her personal travels and those of her family were slightly more extensive, otherwise we should be without her letters. Not only should every Janeite possess them, but also every connoisseur of correspondence. Austen's wit is ubiquitous--even though some protest it edges into waspishness. E. M. Forster, for example, described the letters between Austen and her beloved sister, Cassandra, as "the whinnying of harpies."<p> On September 18, 1796, she tells Cassandra, "What dreadful Hot weather we have!--It keeps one in a continual state of Inelegance.--If Miss Pearson should return with me, pray be careful not to expect too much Beauty..." The dashes and capitalization alone make one long for the days before stylistic rules had so cemented. As for the sentiments! Austen paces her monologues to perfection, making the comic and ironic most out of the smallest incidents. Still, her frustration does occasionally emerge. "I am forced to be abusive," she implodes to Cassandra, "for want of a subject, having nothing really to say." Jane Austen has more than enough to say for lovers of literature and the cultural pinprick.</p><br><strong>Deirdre Le Faye</strong> is Administrator at the British Museum.

In particular, it addresses the emotional difficulties of many of the foster and adopted children living in our country who are unable to form secure attachments. Traditional interventions, which do not teach parents how to successfully engage the child, frequently do not provide the means by which the seriously damaged child can form the secure attachment that underlies behavioral change. Dr. Daniel Hughes maps out a treatment plan designed to help the child begin to experience and accept, from both the therapist and the parents, affective attunement that he or she should have received in the first few years of life. All children, at the core of their beings, need to be attached to someone who considers them to be very special and who is committed to providing for their ongoing care. Children who lose their birth parents desperately need such a relationship if they are to heal and grow. This book shows therapists how to facilitate this crucial bond.

For over a decade he was the coordinator of children's services at Kennebec Valley Mental Health Center and also worked at Colby College Counseling Services. He is in private practice in Waterville, Maine, where he has contracts with foster care agencies.For those treating attachment disordered children with traditional child psychotherapy, this book will compel a reexamination of that approach and lead the way to a decidedly more effective treatment. Therapists struggling to help these children will find countless new insights and concrete examples of how to be successful instead of frustrated in their work. An experienced, gifted, and innovative therapist and teacher, Dan Hughes takes the reader through a primer in attachment theory and reactive attachment disorders in maltreated children, through the theoretical principles and actual techniques employed in therapy, four illustrative case vignettes, and a discussion of how to educate, assist, and support the parents of poorly attached children. (Paul D. Goodman)<br><br>Dr. Hughes's deeply insightful book provides professionals as well as parents with a comprehensive understanding of the issues and of the types of interventions that succeed in resolving them. The scope of this brilliant work extends beyond the disturbances of foster and adoptive children. If all children were treated in the way Dr. Hughes describes, with his compassion, humanity, humor, and depth of understanding, there would be better outcomes. Even for therapists who do not practice in this manner, their grasp of a child's development and their approach to their young patients will be greatly enhanced by Dr. Hughes' theoretical framework of attunement and engagement.

Marshaling meticulous scholarship, this leading critic of American foreign policy cogently argues that Washington's support-open and covert-for repressive regimes in Colombia, Guatemala, Indonesia, Angola and elsewhere has undermined attempts to create meaningful democracy, thus exacerbating poverty and misery. Chomsky, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology linguistics professor, describes NAFTA as a protectionist pact, mislabeled "free trade," which is likely to drive millions of Mexicans out of work while enriching U.S. agribusiness. He sets the Israeli-Arab conflict in the broad context of America's postwar domination of the Middle East along lines established by British imperialism, with family dictatorships taking orders from Washington and protected by "regional enforcers," preferably non-Arab (Turkey, Israel, Iran under the shah, Pakistan). His devastating critique of the "new world order" foresees a growing abyss between rich and poor-both internationally and at home. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Transformations in Late Eighteenth Century Art</h2><p><p>The importance of the late 18th century in the genesis of modern art emerges in these four essays on various aspects of the art and architecture of a neglected period.</p></p><p>"Exceptional in the acuity of its perceptions and the lucidity of its style, Rosenblum's volume of essays is a signal contribution to the understanding and enjoyment of late eighteenth-century art."

Over the last two decades, this term has become synonymous with US strategy during the Vietnam War's final years. The narrative is enticingly simple, appealing to many audiences. After the disastrous results of the 1968 Tet offensive, in which Hanoi's forces demonstrated the failures of American strategy, popular history tells of a new American military commander who emerged in South Vietnam and with inspired leadership and a new approach turned around a long stalemated conflict. In fact, so successful was General Creighton Abrams in commanding US forces that, according to the "better war" myth, the United States had actually achieved victory by mid-1970. A new general with a new strategy had delivered, only to see his victory abandoned by weak-kneed politicians in Washington, DC who turned their backs on the US armed forces and their South Vietnamese allies.<br><br>In a bold new interpretation of America's final years in Vietnam, acclaimed historian Gregory A. Daddis disproves these longstanding myths. <em>Withdrawal</em> is a groundbreaking reassessment that tells a far different story of the Vietnam War. Daddis convincingly argues that the entire US effort in South Vietnam was incapable of reversing the downward trends of a complicated Vietnamese conflict that by 1968 had turned into a political-military stalemate. Despite a new articulation of strategy, Abrams's approach could not materially alter a war no longer vital to US national security or global dominance. Once the Nixon White House made the political decision to withdraw from Southeast Asia, Abrams's military strategy was unable to change either the course or outcome of a decades' long Vietnamese civil war.<br><br>In a riveting sequel to his celebrated <em>Westmoreland's War</em>, Daddis demonstrates he is one of the nation's leading scholars on the Vietnam War.<em> Withdrawal</em> will be a standard work for years to come.<br></p><p><br><strong>Gregory Daddis</strong> is Associate Professor of history and director of Chapman University's MA Program in War and Society.

The evidence he presents on that score is definitive and irrefutable. Yet perhaps more importantly, Daddis shows that the war was never America's to win or to lose in the first place. Vietnam's fate was a matter for the Vietnamese to decide. Apart from sowing death and destruction on a vast scale, U.S. military efforts had no bearing whatsoever on the outcome."--Andrew J.

Second, the functional systems of the brain are explained in terms of how they lead to reading, writing and mathematics and the design of instruction. Thirdly, research is presented, not as a finished product, but as a step forward within the field of educational neuropsychology. The book differs from neuropsychology and neuroscience books in that it is aimed at practitioners, focuses on high incidence neuropsychological conditions seen in the classroom, and is the only book that integrates both brain research with the practice of effective literacy, and mathematics instruction of the general and special education school-aged populations.</p><p>This comprehensive, yet easy to understand primer for educators introduces the structural and functional organization of the brain. Recent research and imaging technologies are used to illustrate how the brain operates in reading, writing, and computing mathematics. This information is used to support select instructional practices and to dispel popular myths on learning styles and maturaltional readiness for advanced learning. Heavily illustrated, and with a number of thoughtful exercises, this book will provide educational professionals and psychology researchers with the necessary neuroscience background to make sense of how the brain is organized, how to optimally construct learning environments, and best practices for teaching.Professor of Educational Psychology at the University of Washington; Director of the NICHD funded Multidisciplinary Learning Disabilities Center<br><br>Professor of Radiology at the University of Washington; Principle Investigator for the Brain Imaging Project at the Multidisciplinary Learning Disabilities Center</p><h2>Europe in the Twentieth Century</h2><p>EUROPE IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY offers a comprehensive, yet streamlined narrative of twentieth-century Europe.

This company produced special events and entertainment in Canada and overseas for many diverse clients. For example, these included: original musical theatre productions in Barkerville, BC; the millennium First Night celebrations in Vancouver, BC; the annual Leo Awards for BC film and television; and four entertainment show tours for the Canadian Armed Forces to the Arctic, Afghanistan, Bosnia, Cambodia, Egypt, and Israel. Pacific Show Productions was regularly nominated for special event awards both in Canada and the United States and won several awards under Matthews's leadership. The company was sold in 2004. Matthews is an accomplished speaker, delivering seminars at special event conventions and courses at community colleges in the areas of entertainment, creativity, and event production management. He is currently on the faculty of Capilano College in North Vancouver, BC, where he teaches Special Events as Tourism Generators and Advanced Special Event Planning and Production to Asian and North American students. Matthews remains involved in the industry as a member of the Canadian Special Event Society and serves on the advisory board of an international consortium of special event production companies called TEAM Net, based in Atlanta, Georgia, of which he was president in 2002-04. His published articles range from technical engineering papers for military audiences to pieces for special event publications, as well as original music and mini-plays. His most recent publishing success is a self-published book on special events, How to Create Fantasies and Win Accolades: A Practical Guide to Planning Special Events, which has received critical acclaim in the USA and Canada.<p></p><p><strong><em>"Special Event Production: The Process</em> is an excellent book describing the complicated process of event production. It's a must have for anyone who wants to learn about this industry. Many people think it's easy to produce events. This book will teach them how complex it is and how much a producer needs to know. This book covers all the key aspects and presents them clearly, in order of timeline of a production, and even has appendixes with contracts, time sheets, budgets and other examples. I'm a producer myself and teach Event Design to graduate students. They love this book and one of their most often repeated comments is: "I never know producing an event was so involved." This book helps them understand and navigate the many steps for the production itself, as well as the broad knowledge of the many factors a producer has to have." - </strong><em>Corinna Sager, Lifestyle International Productions LLC</em></p> <p>"<strong>Matthew's two books, "Special Event Production," are a must-have for anyone in the field, whether a newcomer or an old hand. The author has organized this complicated subject well. Lavishly illustrated, laid-out with side-bars, diagrams, and examples, the reader will find everything they need in the two volumes. In fact, I found the books welcoming and accessible with plenty of white space, and the detailed table of contents and good index make looking up a topic easy. These two volumes should become the gold standard in special event production. Highly readable and highly recommended."</strong> - <em>Julie Ferguson, Professional Speaker and Event Organizer</em></p></p><h2>Take Care of Yourself: The Complete Illustrated Guide to Medical Self-Care</h2><p><i>Take Care of Yourself</i> is the world's best-selling health guide, and the only one that has been found to help reduce visits to the doctor. It is easy to use, even in a crisis. Simply look up a symptom and you will find a complete explanation of likely causes and how you might relieve that problem at home. Diagrams help you recognize problems and, in many cases, treat them quickly and easily. Easy-to-follow decision charts tell you exactly when to see a doctor. <i>Take Care of Yourself</i> also covers emergencies, how to avoid health problems, what to keep in a home pharmacy, and how to work best with your doctor.</p><p>"In our quest for a symptom-free existence, we make millions of unnecessary visits to doctors--as many as 70% of all visits are for new problems," write the authors, both physicians. "For every type of problem, there are some instances in which you should decide to see the doctor and some in which you should not." How do you decide? That's where <i>Take Care of Yourself</i> comes in.<p> Here's how it works. When you have a new medical problem, first read the emergency signs in the "Emergencies" chapter to see if you need to get medical attention pronto. If not (and most medical situations are not emergencies), look up your main complaint or symptom. There you find a decision flow chart that asks you yes/no questions, and your answers direct you to a probable cause and either medical care or home treatment. If home treatment is appropriate, you get an explanation of what to do, what not to do, and when to see your doctor if the problem doesn't go away. If a doctor's visit is recommended, you learn what to expect when you get there. There's not much detail on any one topic: one and one-half to two pages on each of more than 175 health problems (large and small), including charts and illustrations. But it's a handy guide and a good first step when it's essential to know what to do quickly, and for that reason several major HMOs distribute it to their members.</p><p> Because good health habits help you avoid medical problems, you get a brief guide to getting started with exercise, good nutrition, smoking cessation, alcohol moderation, weight control, avoiding injury, and professional prevention (checkups, screening, early treatment, etc.). It's also an interesting to read in a <i>Worst-Case Scenario Survival Handbook</i> kind of way--who knows when you might need to know how to pull out a tick, or release trapped blood under a nail using a heated paper clip and pliers? <i>--Joan Price</i></p><b>Donald M.

The result is a unique textbook that engagingly and comprehensively embraces the entire expanse of human prehistory while also offering the most up-to-date accounts of separate regions and periods by the leading specialists in these areas. There are hundreds of maps, diagrams, and photographs, many in full color, as well as timelines and boxes on key sites, methods, discoveries, and controversies.<br><br> For the second edition, the text has been thoroughly updated to include recent discoveries and new interpretations from around the world. The coverage of archaeology in the Middle East is expanded to include the Jiroft excavations in Iran and the Late Bronze Age in Qatna, Syria. The Americas section includes new dates for Clovis sites and new information on Kennewick man. There is also a new discussion on the link between climate change in Mesoamerica and the many historical changes: the Classic Maya collapse, in particular. 770 illustrations, 219 in color</p><p>Chris Scarre is Professor of Archaeology at Durham University. He is a specialist in European prehistory with a related interest in the ancient Near East and the Classical world of Greece and Rome. He was editor and principal author of Past Worlds: The Times Atlas of Archaeology (1995); more recently he co-authored Ancient Civilizations (with Brian Fagan, 3rd ed., 2007). He has directed and co-directed excavations at prehistoric sites in France, Portugal, and the Channel Islands, most recently exploring the prehistoric monuments of Herm (Guernsey). His current research interests include the study of archaeoacoustics and the color, origin, and symbolic significance of materials in the Neolithic monuments of Western Europe.</p><h2>McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Scientific and Technical Terms</h2><p>An updated edition--complete with diskette version--of a top international technical dictionary adds thousands of new terms from one hundred scientific and technical fields, defining all accurately but in terms laypeople can understand, with thousands of illustrations.</p><p>This dictionary, last published in 1989, continues to provide clear, concise definitions for the educated general public. The fifth edition has 2,194 pages (57 more than the fourth), 105,100 terms (5,000 more than the fourth), and 3,000 black-and-white photographs (the same as the fourth). It is arranged alphabetically letter by letter, lies flat when open, and is a heavy volume that may present problems in retrieving from the shelf. There are no major changes in the format of this edition.<p>With the publication of the <i>Academic Press Dictionary of Science and Technology</i> [RBB Ja 15 93], a comparison is in order. The biggest difference is the lack of pronunciation in <i>Academic</i>, a definite advantage for <i>McGraw-Hill</i>, when the general public encounters so many science and technology terms in print media today. A minor disadvantage is that <i>McGraw-Hill</i> refers the user from an acronym to the spelled-out form, while <i>Academic</i> gives the definition under the acronym if it is well recognized. Definitions vary from one dictionary to the other. <i>AIDS</i> is better defined in <i>Academic</i>, giving indications of how it is transmitted, while <i>chugging</i>, an aeronautical term, is more expanded in <i>McGraw-Hill</i>. Biographical sketches are in the dictionary portion of <i>Academic</i> but in a separate appendix in <i>McGraw-Hill</i>. Both dictionaries indicate the field with which the term is associated. Only <i>Academic</i> has entries for "combining forms" or prefixes used to build many words.</p><p>The size of both dictionaries is comparable. However, in comparing entries, each dictionary has unique terms. Since both are similar, <i>McGraw-Hill</i> has the advantage of being three years newer. <i>McGraw-Hill</i> is the only one to be thumb-indexed. It also has a diskette included with the book that includes a subset of the entries, those for basic technical terms. It can be installed on the hard drive of computers running WordPerfect or several other popular software programs.</p><p>For libraries that need as much coverage as possible of science and technology terminology, both dictionaries are highly recommended because of the unique terms found in each. High-school libraries will tend to have the <i>McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of Science and Technology</i>, so the <i>McGraw-Hill Dictionary</i> would be favored as a companion. <i></i></p>"This is a well-designed, attractive dictionary with alphabetical thumb-indexed pages that should be of great use to scientists, as well as other adults who are involved and interested in science and technology." -- <i>Washton, Nathan S., Science Books &amp; Films, 08/94</i><br><br>"This recently published fifth edition of an industry standard dictionary will be an indispensable tool for the broader public, rather than simply remaining in the province of the specialist. Covering approximately 100 technical fields, this new dictionary will be a valuable addition to any bookshelf." -- <i>IEEE Electrical Insulation Magazine, 07/94</i></p><h2>Retail Buying: From Basics to Fashion</h2><p><strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong> Purchasing or renting this ISBN does not include access to the STUDIO resources that accompany this text.

Truth and Existence, written in response to Martin Heidegger&#39;s The Essence of Truth, is a product of the years when Sartre was reaching full stature as a philosopher, novelist, playwright, essayist, and political activist. This brief, coherent, and engaging text presents Sartre&#39;s ontology of truth in terms of his characteristic key moral questions of freedom, action, and bad faith. While stressing the intuitive and personal dimensions of truth, Truth and Existence also explores the argument that ignoring is an intentional act starting, like all knowledge, from the primary ontological condition of ignorance. Thus, at the heart of Sartre&#39;s discussion are explanations of ignorance (as resulting from the choice to ignore), phenomenological descriptions (of behavior seeking to avoid the truth), and the reasons why one chooses to avoid the truth. Sartre explores why one Madame T., afflicted with tuberculosis, should choose to ignore the disease that is killing her rather than take responsibility for it. Here is Sartre the existentialist at his most original and most provocative: this work of epistemology, based on ontology, becomes a work of ethics. At the same time, Truth and Existence foreshadows and lays thebasis for some of the most important insights of the Critique of Dialectical Reason. Truth and Existence is introduced by an extended biographical, historical, and analytical essay by Ronald Aronson.<b>Jean-Paul Sartre</b> (1905-1980) was a French novelist, playwright, and biographer who is widely recognized as one of the most important philosophers of the twentieth century.

A proud and fiercely independent woman, she struggled against great odds to establish federally sponsored schools in remote settlements. This is her own story of her many adventures on the Alaskan frontier. Breece compiled a draft of her experiences from her diaries and letters, but never completed the project. Before she died, she entrusted the manuscript to her great-niece Jane Jacobs, and this delightful book is the results. Jane Jacobs visited the communities her great-aunt described to fill in some of the gaps in her story. Her original research complements Hannah Breece&#39;s story to give us a vivid picture of old Alaska, of the infant settlements of Juneau, Kodiak, Seward and Fairbanks, and of the amazing woman who conquered its frozen wilderness, loved its children and, for nearly fifteen years, made it her home.Born in Pennsylvania in1859, <b>Hannah Breece</b> taught on Indian reservations in midwest America before accepting a government post to teach in Alaska.<br><br><b>Jane Jacobs</b> is the author of several books, including the <i>Death And Life of Great American Cities, Cities And The Wealth of Nations</i>, and most recently, the bestselling <i>Systems of Survival</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;She lives in Toronto.</p><h2>Odd Girls and Twilight Lovers: A History of Lesbian Life in Twentieth-Century America</h2><p>As Lillian Faderman writes, there are &#34;no constants with regard to lesbianism,&#34; except that lesbians prefer women.

With patience and ingenuity, he transforms his island into a tropical paradise. For twenty-four years he has no human company, until one Friday, he rescues a prisoner from a boat of cannibals.</p><p>This classic story of a shipwrecked mariner on a deserted island is perhaps the greatest adventure in all of English literature. Fleeing from pirates, Robinson Crusoe is swept ashore in a storm possessing only a knife, a box of tobacco, a pipe-and the will to survive. His is the saga of a man alone: a man who overcomes self-pity and despair to reconstruct his life; who painstakingly teaches himself how to fashion a pot, bake bread, build a canoe; and who, after twenty-four agonizing years of solitude, discovers a human footprint in the sand... Consistently popular since its first publication in 1719, Daniel Defoe's story of human endurance in an exotic, faraway land exerts a timeless appeal. The first important English novel, <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> has taken its rightful place among the great myths of Western civilization.<p>Thought to have been inspired by the true-life experiences of a marooned sailor, <i>Robinson Crusoe </i>tells the story of the sole survivor of a shipwreck, stranded on a Caribbean island, who prevails against all odds, enduring almost three decades of solitude while mastering both himself and his strange new world. First published in 1719, the novel has long been one of the English language's great adventure stories.<br>In the journal he shares with us, the endearing, goatskin-clad castaway recounts the details of this lonely existence and his many adventures, including a fierce battle with cannibals and a daring rescue of Friday, the man who becomes his trusted servant and companion. Defoe's brilliant and imaginative use of detail renders Crusoe's island world utterly convincing. In reclaiming his humanity from the savagery of his circumstances, the hero humbly acquires the qualities of courage, patience, ingenuity, and industry.<br>Hailed as the first great English novel, <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> spawned legions of imitations, none of which surpass the original. All readers with a taste for adventure will relish this inexpensive edition of one of the most popular and influential books ever written.</p></p><h2>The Empowerment Approach to Social Work Practice</h2><p>First published in 1994, this book was hailed as a cutting-edge, theory-driven report from the front-line trenches in the battle for social justice.

Created in close consultation with a cross-section of American teachers, administrators, and scientists, <em>Benchmarks</em> elaborates on the recommendations to provide guidelines for what all students should know and be able to do in science, mathematics, and technology by the end of grades 2, 5, 8, and 12. These grade levels offer reasonable checkpoints for student progress toward science literacy, but do not suggest a rigid formula for teaching. <em>Benchmarks</em> is not a proposed curriculum, nor is it a plan for one: it is a tool educators can use as they design curricula that fit their student's needs and meet the goals first outlined in <em>Science for All Americans</em>. Far from pressing for a single educational program, Project 2061 advocates a reform strategy that will lead to more curriculum diversity than is common today.<br> IBenchmarks emerged from the work of six diverse school-district teams who were asked to rethink the K-12 curriculum and outline alternative ways of achieving science literacy for all students. These teams based their work on published research and the continuing advice of prominent educators, as well as their own teaching experience. Focusing on the understanding and interconnection of key concepts rather than rote memorization of terms and isolated facts, <em>Benchmarks</em> advocates building a lasting understanding of science and related fields. In a culture increasingly pervaded by science, mathematics, and technology, science literacy require habits of mind that will enable citizens to understand the world around them, make some sense of new technologies as they emerge and grow, and deal sensibly with problems that involve evidence, numbers, patterns, logical arguments, and technology--as well as the relationship of these disciplines to the arts, humanities, and vocational sciences--making science literacy relevant to all students, regardless of their career paths.<br> If Americans are to participate in a world shaped by modern science and mathematics, a world where technological know-how will offer the keys to economic and political stability in the twenty-first century, education in these areas must become one of the nation's highest priorities. Together with <em>Science for All Americans</em>, <em>Benchmarks for Science Literacy</em> offers a bold new agenda for the future of science education in this country, one that is certain to prepare our children for life in the twenty-first century.</p><p><br>Since its founding in 1848, the <strong>American Association for the Advancement of Science</strong> has continually worked to advance science, initially by promoting communication and cooperation between scientists, and, more recently, by enhancing the public understanding and appreciation of science in human progress. An international organization, the AAAS includes over 140,000 scientists, engineers, science educators, policymakers, and others interested in science and technology.<br>"For those teachers who still need direction (generally speaking) about the content they should be teaching . . . and the cognitive enhancement of their students."--John Burns, California Polytechnic, Pomona<br><br>"All teachers need to read Benchmarks, especially the research findings in Chapter 12.

A milestone publication."--George D. Nelson, University of Washington<br><br>"At a time when the debate over the effectiveness of the U.S. educational system has grown increasingly acrimonious, Benchmarks offers a valuable yardstick for measuring progress."--Charles Solomon, Los Angeles Times Book Review<br><br>"An excellent resource that gives broad benchmarks for science. The goals are laudable. The work now needs to take place on how to implement these goals."--Ted Moon, Columbia International University<br><br>"A thoughtful follow up to Science For All Americans. This work should be required reading for all persons contemplating or implementing modifications in the science curriculum at all levels of learning."--Everett Follette, Black Hills State University<br><br>"Essential for all school libraries."--Library Journal<br><br>"Benchmarks for Science Literacy, a follow-up to the AAAS' Project 2061 landmark 'Science for All Americans', represents the first comprehensive and detailed set of guidelines to be issued that describes the knowledge and abilities that all students need by the end of grades 2, 5, 8 and 12 to<br>be science literate and to succeed in the workforce. 'Benchmarks for Science Literacy' accomplishes its goal not by offering a standard curriculum to be adopted locally, but by providing educators in every state and school district with a powerful tool to use in fashioning their own curricula. The<br>AAAS and other top science educators are working hard to devise a science education, to promote 'science literacy', for all students.

This book sets the empiricists in their contemporary and cultural context, examines their various approaches to philosophy, and highlights the significance of their ideas to 20th-century thinking. By focusing on what the "empiricists" actually have to say, rather than on their classification as such, Woolhouse incidentally shows how unreliable these conventional labels can be.<br></p><p>&#39;One of the great historic controversies in philosophy&#39; was how Bertrand Russell described the ideological conflict between rationalist and empiricists-the conflict between reason and experience as sources of knowledge and ideas.R. S. Woolhouse is Reader in Philosophy at the University of York.</p><h2>The Poetry of Zen (Shambhala Library)</h2><p>A Zen poem is nothing other than an expression of the enlightened mind, a handful of simple words that disappear beneath the moment of insight to which it bears witness. Poetry has been an essential aid to Zen Buddhist practice from the dawn of Zen&#x2014;and Zen has also had a profound influence on the secular poetry of the countries in which it has flourished. Here, two of America's most renowned poets and translators provide an overview of Zen poetry from China and Japan in all its rich variety, from the earliest days to the twentieth century. Included are works by Lao Tzu, Han Shan, Li Po, Dogen Kigen, Saigyo, Basho, Chiao Jan, Yuan Mei, Ryokan, and many others. Sam Hamill and J. P. Seaton provide illuminating introductions to the Chinese and Japanese sections that set the poets and their work in historical context. Short biographies of the poets are also included.</p><p>Sam Hamill is the author of more than thirty books of poetry, essays, and translations from the classical Chinese and Japanese, ancient Greek, Latin, and other languages. He has been a recipient of fellowships from the Woodrow Wilson Foundation, the Andrew Mellon Foundation, the National Endowment for the Arts, the Guggenheim Foundation, and the Japan-U.S. Friendship Commission. He lives near Port Townsend, Washington.Hamill, founding editor of Copper Canyon Press, and J. P. Seaton, a professor of Chinese, unite forces to translate and edit this collection of Zen poetry from China and Japan. More than an anthology, this is a little Zen primer with brief bios of all of the poets and insightful introductions that illuminate the collection in the context of Buddhist history and practice. As Hamill explains, poetry has long been part of Zen practice, and it seems not only to express deep philosophical and spiritual questions, but also to provoke them. Poignantly summarizing the "why" of creating this collection, Hamill states, "A good poem says more than the sum of its words, leading the reader into the practice of understanding the great unsaid that is contained, framed in a poem's rhythms, words, and silences." These poems indeed lead one to meditate on the quality of the mind, the nature of life. This may be a little book, but it is a major collection. <i>Janet St. John</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

Hope is really about having goals and knowing how to attain them. Hopeful people see goals as challenges, while others view them as threats. Hopeful people choose higher and more difficult goals and generate alternataive solutions to problems. The hopeful news is hope can be learned.

This readable exposition of the nature of time as addressed in Einstein's theory of relativity is accessible to anyone who remembers a little high school algebra and elementary plane geometry.</p><br><p> The book evolved as Mermin taught the subject to diverse groups of undergraduates at Cornell University, none of them science majors, over three and a half decades. Mermin's approach is imaginative, yet accurate and complete. Clear, lively, and informal, the book will appeal to intellectually curious readers of all kinds, including even professional physicists, who will be intrigued by its highly original approach.</p></p><p><br><p>"David Mermin's new book is a gem. Requiring nothing more than a basic understanding of algebra, it provides the clearest and most insightful treatment of special relativity I've ever encountered. Students new to special relativity should learn it from this text; those already familiar with the subject should read this book to enhance their understanding and (of equal importance) to experience the craft of a master teacher."<b>--Brian Greene, Columbia University</b><br></p><br><p>"This book includes material that is intellectually innovative and comes as a surprise even to specialists in the field. Its uniqueness, its insights, and its wonderful style will likely make it a classic."<b>--Richard Price, University of Utah</b><br></p><br><p>"Well-written, chatty and engaging, this book will be accessible to scientists and non-scientists alike."<b>--Robert Geroch, University of Chicago</b><br></p><br><p>"The reader who works through this book carefully will have quite a good understanding of what special relativity is all about.

Tina S. Fredericks offers a friendly recollection of Warhol in 1949, new to New York and as full of eccentricities as we might expect. She then takes us on a compact journey of her contacts with Warhol over the next four decades. Tucked in with these observations is Kornbluth's essay, which displays an artist breezing to success in the world of fashion, advertising, and magazine illustration. Kornbluth delivers enticing tidbits of Warhol's economic situation and social life as well. True to the Pop Warhol, the art shown here was often colored, copied, and completed by the artist's employees, but these shoes, cats, birds, and brisk portraits remain Warhol's.

Why is this disappearance important to democratic politics and how has it become an international phenomenon? Public spaces are no longer democratic spaces, but instead centres of private commerce and consumption, and even surveillance and police control. "The Politics of Public Space" extends the focus of current work on public space to include a consideration of the transnational - in the sense of moving people and transformations in the nation or state - to expand our definition of the 'public' and public space. Ultimately, public spaces are one of the last democratic forums for public dissent in a civil society. Without these significant central public spaces, individuals cannot directly participate in conflict resolution. "The Politics of Public Space" assembles a superb list of contributors to explore the important political dimensions of public space as a place where conflicts over cultural and political objectives become concrete. </p></p><p><strong>Setha Low</strong> is Professor of anthropology and environmental psychology at the CUNY Graduate Center.

Despite the word&#x2019;s ubiquity today, few realize that it began as a translation of <i>Einfï¿½hlung </i>(&#x201c;in-feeling&#x201d;), a term in German psychological aesthetics that described how spectators projected their own feelings and movements into objects of art and nature.<br> &nbsp;<br> Remarkably, this early conception of empathy transformed into its opposite over the ensuing decades. Social scientists and clinical psychologists refashioned empathy to require the deliberate putting aside of one&#x2019;s feelings to more accurately understand another&#x2019;s. By the end of World War II, interpersonal empathy entered the mainstream, appearing in advice columns, popular radio and TV, and later in public forums on civil rights. Even as neuroscientists continue to map the brain correlates of empathy, its many dimensions still elude strict scientific description.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> This meticulously researched book uncovers empathy&#x2019;s historical layers, offering a rich portrait of the tension between the reach of one&#x2019;s own imagination and the realities of others&#x2019; experiences.</p></p><p><b>Susan Lanzoni</b> is a historian of psychology, psychiatry, and neuroscience.

When confronted with nonviolent resistance on the part of the downtrodden, however, governments have often crumbled--witness the fall of South Africa's apartheid regime and the ousting of Slobodan Milosevic in Yugoslavia. <p> The worldwide spread of democracy in the 20th century, documentary writers Peter Ackerman and Jack DuVall maintain, "would not have come to pass without the power of ordinary people who defied oppressive rulers not by force of arms, but by nonviolent action." By way of example, they cite the collapse of the Argentine military regime following peaceful protests by the mothers of men and women who had been murdered by the secret police; the eventual undermining of the Polish Communist regime by the nonviolent Solidarity labor movement; the refusal of the Danish people to comply with the laws of their Nazi occupiers during World&nbsp;War&nbsp;II; and the exemplary work done in India (and, earlier, South Africa) by Mohandas Gandhi, who took pains to emphasize that nonviolence does not imply passivity.</p><p> Ackerman and DuVall's book, the companion volume to a PBS television series, will be of much interest to political activists of all stripes, as well as to students of contemporary history. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>Peter Ackerman holds a Ph.D. in International Relations from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. <p>Jack DuVall is a writer and television producer, and former political speechwriter and intelligence officer.</p></p><h2>The New Cambridge Modern History, Vol. 6: The Rise of Great Britain and Russia, 1688-1715/25</h2><p>Volume VI draws attention to two of the paramount developments which, with the growth of the Hapsburg monarchy, affected all of Europe and many parts of the Americas during the period under survey.

This rich and complex book, at once a love story, a devastating, and bitterly funny social satire, and, perhaps most movingly of all, a heartfelt celebration of the immense beauty of the Russian countryside, is a tragic masterpiece in which one of the world's finest novelists confronts the enduring question of the place of happiness in a political world.</p><p>Ivan Sergeyevich Turgenev (1818-1883) was born into a wealthy family of the Russian landed gentry and educated in Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Berlin. He made his name as a writer with&nbsp;<i>A Sportsman&#x2019;s Sketches,</i>&nbsp;an unvarnished picture of Russian country life that is said to have influenced Tsar Alexander&nbsp;II&#x2019;s decision to liberate the serfs. In later years, Turgenev lived in Europe, returning only rarely to his native country. He was the author of poems, stories, plays, and six novels, the most celebrated of which include&nbsp;<i>Fathers and Sons, Rudin,</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>On the </i>Eve.&nbsp;<br><br>Charlotte Hobson&nbsp;divides her time between translating and writing. She is the&nbsp;author&nbsp;of <i>Black Earth City.</i><br><br>Constance Garnett&nbsp;(1861&#x2013;1946) was an English&nbsp;translator&nbsp;of nineteenth-century Russian literature, and introduced&nbsp;Tolstoy,&nbsp;Dostoevsky&nbsp;and&nbsp;Chekhov&nbsp;on a wide basis to the English speaking public.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Russian</p><h2>Profiles in Saltwater Angling</h2><p>This is the remarkable story of the men, past and present, who discovered the fishing grounds and developed, through the trial and error, the techniques and equipment for catching and landing the big ones.

Shankar focuses on how South Asian Americans, or &#x201c;Desis,&#x201d; define and manage what it means to be successful in a place brimming with the promise of technology. Between 1999 and 2001 Shankar spent many months &#x201c;kickin&#x2019; it&#x201d; with Desi teenagers at three Silicon Valley high schools, and she has since followed their lives and stories. The diverse high-school students who populate <i>Desi Land </i>are Muslims, Hindus, Christians, and Sikhs, from South Asia and other locations; they include first- to fourth-generation immigrants whose parents&#x2019; careers vary from assembly-line workers to engineers and CEOs. By analyzing how Desi teens&#x2019; conceptions and realizations of success are influenced by community values, cultural practices, language use, and material culture, she offers a nuanced portrait of diasporic formations in a transforming urban region.<p></p><p>Whether discussing instant messaging or arranged marriages, Desi bling or the pressures of the model minority myth, Shankar foregrounds the teens&#x2019; voices, perspectives, and stories. She investigates how Desi teens interact with dialogue and songs from Bollywood films as well as how they use their heritage language in ways that inform local meanings of ethnicity while they also connect to a broader South Asian diasporic consciousness. She analyzes how teens negotiate rules about dating and reconcile them with their longer-term desire to become adult members of their communities. In <i>Desi Land</i> Shankar not only shows how Desi teens of different socioeconomic backgrounds are differently able to succeed in Silicon Valley schools and economies but also how such variance affects meanings of race, class, and community for South Asian Americans.</p></p><p>&#34;An excellent, ethnographically rich study of the lives and practices of young South Asian Americans living in Silicon Valley, &#34;Desi Land&#34; lends itself to use in courses in fields including anthropology, cultural studies, gender studies, and Asian American studies. What I like best of all is that Shalini Shankar trains her lens on a particular generation&#39;s experience while providing us with a rich cultural history of life in Silicon Valley at the turn of the twenty-first century.&#34;--Purnima Mankekar, author of &#34;Screening Culture, Viewing Politics: An Ethnography of Television, Womanhood, and Nation in Postcolonial India&#34;<p>Shalini Shankar is Assistant Professor of Anthropology and Asian American Studies at Northwestern University.</p></p><h2>Printmaking: A Complete Guide to Materials &amp; Processes</h2><p><i>Printmaking; a Complete Guide to Materials and Process</i> covers fundamental&nbsp;printmaking techniques including relief, intaglio, collagraph, lithography, screen print and monoprint. &nbsp;The book&nbsp;outlines current practices in the contemporary print studio,&nbsp;including integrating digital processes with all techniques.

The archive has thus emerged as a key site of inquiry in such fields as anthropology, critical theory, history, and, especially, recent art. Traces and testimonies of such events as World War II and ensuing conflicts, the emergence of the postcolonial era, and the fall of communism have each provoked a reconsideration of the authority given the archive&#x2015;no longer viewed as a neutral, transparent site of record but as a contested subject and medium in itself.</p><p>This volume surveys the full diversity of our transformed theoretical and critical notions of the archive&#x2015;as idea and as physical presence&#x2015;from Freud's "mystic writing pad" to Derrida's "archive fever"; from Christian Boltanski's first autobiographical explorations of archival material in the 1960s to the practice of artists as various as Susan Hiller, Ilya Kabakov, Thomas Hirshhorn, Renï¿½e Green, and The Atlas Group in the present.</p><p>Not for sale in the UK and Europe.</p></p><p>Charles Merewether is an art historian and writer on contemporary and postwar art who has taught at universities in the United States, Central and South America, and Australia.

With this statement, Bryan Palmer enters the debate that is now transforming and disrupting a number of academic disciplines, including political science, womenOCOs studies, and history. Focusing on the ways in which literary or critical theory is being promoted within the field of social history, he argues forcefully that the current reliance on poststructuralismOCowith its reification of discourse and avoidance of the structures of oppression and struggles of resistanceOCoobscures the origins, meanings, and consequences of historical events and processes. Palmer is concerned with the emergence of language as a central focus of intellectual work in the twentieth century. He locates the implosion of theory that moved structuralism in the direction of poststructuralism and deconstruction in what he calls the descent into discourse. Few historians who champion poststructuralist thought, according to Palmer, appreciate historical materialismOCOs capacity to address discourse meaningfully. Nor do many of the advocates of language within the field of social history have an adequate grounding in the theoretical making of the project they champion so ardently. Palmer roots his polemical challenge in an effort to introduce historians more fully to the theoretical writing that many are alluding to and drawing from rather cavalierly.Acknowledging that critical theory can contribute to an understanding of some aspects of the past, Palmer nevertheless argues for the centrality of materialism to the project of history. In specific discussions of how critical theory is constructing histories of politics, class, and gender, he traces the development of the descent into discourse within social history, mapping the limitations of recent revisionist texts. Much of this writing, he contends, is undertheorized and represents a problematic retreat from prior histories that attempted to address such material forces as economic structures, political power, and class struggle.&#34;Descent into Discourse&#34;acounters current intellectual fashion with an eloquent argument for the necessity to analyze and appreciate lived experience and the structures of subordination and power in any quest for historical meaning. a&#34;</p><p>Arguing that the current reliance on poststructuralism obscures the origins, meanings, and consequences of historical events and processesBryan D.

Neither man was ever satisfied with the standard interpretation of quantum mechanics, however, and both rebelled against what they considered the most preposterous aspect of quantum mechanics: its randomness. Einstein famously quipped that God does not play dice with the universe, and Schrï¿½dinger constructed his famous fable of a cat that was neither alive nor dead not to explain quantum mechanics but to highlight the apparent absurdity of a theory gone wrong. But these two giants did more than just criticize: they fought back, seeking a Theory of Everything that would make the universe seem sensible again.<br><br>In <i>Einstein's Dice and Schrï¿½dinger's Cat</i>, physicist Paul Halpern tells the little-known story of how Einstein and Schrï¿½dinger searched, first as collaborators and then as competitors, for a theory that transcended quantum weirdness. This story of their quest-which ultimately failed-provides readers with new insights into the history of physics and the lives and work of two scientists whose obsessions drove its progress.<br><br>Today, much of modern physics remains focused on the search for a Theory of Everything. As Halpern explains, the recent discovery of the Higgs Boson makes the Standard Model-the closest thing we have to a unified theory- nearly complete. And while Einstein and Schrï¿½dinger failed in their attempt to explain everything in the cosmos through pure geometry, the development of string theory has, in its own quantum way, brought this idea back into vogue. As in so many things, even when they were wrong, Einstein and Schrï¿½dinger couldn't help but get a great deal right.<br></p><p><b>Paul Halpern</b> is a professor of physics at the University of the Sciences in Philadelphia, and the author of thirteen popular science books, most recently <i>Edge of the Universe</i>. He is the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship, a Fulbright Scholarship, and an Athenaeum Literary Award. Halpern has appeared on numerous radio and television shows including "Future Quest," "Radio Times," several shows on the History Channel, and <i>The Simpsons 20th Anniversary Special</i>. He has contributed opinion pieces for the <i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i>, and is also a regular contributor to NOVA's "The Nature of Reality" physics blog. He lives in Wynnewood, Pennsylvania."A fascinating and thought-provoking story, one that sheds light on the origins of some aspects of the current challenging situation in physics...Mr. Halpern's engaging account is a great human story and should be of interest as well to anyone fascinated by the still-unsolved questions that they pursued together."<b><i>-Wall Street Journal</i></b><br>"[A] fascinating book... Halpern, a professor of physics, takes the time to explain the intricacies and significance of the two men's work in wonderfully clear ways. He employs helpful analogies and metaphors to lower the reader gently into a strange new world...[written with] entertaining and evocative prose...[an] insightful book."<b><i>-New Scientist </i></b><br>"Physicist Paul Halpern tells the entangled tale of Albert Einstein, Erwin Schrodinger and their search for a Grand Unified Theory with humour and concision."<b>-Nature </b><br><br>"This book can be put on the reading list of those who have enjoyed <i>The Theory of Everything</i> and want to know more."<b><i>-Physics World</i></b><br>"Entralling."<b><i>-Mathematics Teacher</i></b><br><br>"Halpern's book has an enormous richness of detail about both men's lives and work."<b><i>-The Observatory </i></b><br>"That's a lot to cover in a single book, and the author masters this challenge most thoroughly. While the science is covered in detail, the tone and narrative are accessible to readers with all levels of mathematical and physics proficiency. The author has served science writing well by casting light on the relationship between these two pioneers of quantum physics....Indeed, there are lessons about the often-messy process of science in this book for students, scientists, and citizens alike."<b><i>-MAA Reviews </i></b><br><br>"Assuming no science background from his audience, Halpern explains the necessary background physics to follow the evolution of the ideas. Summing Up: Highly recommended. All readership levels."<b><i>-Choice </i></b><br>"A highly approachable book that will appeal to readers...who are interested in physics, the history of science, and the human and political aspects of scientists and their work."<b><i>-Library Journal</i></b> "With verve, Halpern explores the fragile nature of scientific collaboration... Halpern ably explores the clashing personalities and worldviews that had physics in churning ferment during the early part of the 20th century."<b><i>-Kirkus Reviews </i></b><br><br>"We have seen books that celebrate Einstein and Schrodinger as two of the greatest scientists of all time. With clarity and diligence, Halpern does something different as he explores how intellectual curiosity and vanity get enmeshed with power struggles and the media to bring out the worst in good-willing people, especially when the stakes are as high as the creation of a God-like 'theory of everything.'" <b>-Marcelo Gleiser, author of <i>The Island of Knowledge</i></b><br>"As a fan of popular science books and someone who has used phrases such as 'God does not play dice' and 'Schrodinger's Cat' in my songs, I found Paul Halpern's book illuminating and entertaining." <b>-Roland Orzabal, co-founding member of Tears for Fears</b> <br>"Writing with verve and insight, Paul Halpern tells a striking cautionary tale about friendship, vanity, and the quest to make a great discovery. He gives an exceptionally lucid and engaging account of modern physics, embedded in a rich human tapestry centered on Einstein, Schrodinger, and their friends." <b>-Peter Pesic, author of <i>Music and the Making of Modern Science </i>and Director of the Science Institute at St. John's College in Santa Fe, NM</b><br><br>"This is history of science writing at its best-effortless prose, juicy details and a fascinating narrative that casts familiar territory in a whole new light. The friendship and betrayal between Einstein and Schrodinger is a little known story, and Halpern brings it to life with a historian's care, a physicist's knowledge, and a writer's charm. The book provides a poignant look at how philosophy drives scientific progress and an important critique of how the media shapes and distorts it." <b>-Amanda Gefter, author of <i>Trespassing on Einstein's Lawn</i></b><br>"<i>Einstein's Dice and Schrodinger's Cat</i> is a fascinating, well-written account of how these two men struggled with one of the most puzzling features of quantum mechanics, the appearance of randomness in nature. Both general and specialist readers will find it of interest." <b>-David C. Cassidy, Professor of Chemistry at Hofstra University and author of <i>Beyond Uncertainty: Heisenberg, Quantum Physics, and the Bomb</i></b> "With his trademark grace and clarity, Paul Halpern shines new light on the personalities, lives, and achievements of two of the twentieth century's greatest theoretical physics, at the same time illuminating the fascinating interactions between the two.

In this work, Wayne C. Booth cuts through the resulting confusions by analyzing how we manage to share quite specific ironies&#x2014;and why we often fail when we try to do so. How does a reader or listener recognize the kind of statement which requires him to reject its "clear" and "obvious" meaning? And how does any reader know where to stop, once he has embarked on the hazardous and exhilarating path of rejecting "what the words say" and reconstructing "what the author means"? <br><br>In the first and longer part of his work, Booth deals with the workings of what he calls "stable irony," irony with a clear rhetorical intent. He then turns to intended instabilities&#x2014;ironies that resist interpretation and finally lead to the "infinite absolute negativities" that have obsessed criticism since the Romantic period. <br><br>Professor Booth is always ironically aware that no one can fathom the unfathomable. But by looking closely at unstable ironists like Samuel Becket, he shows that at least some of our commonplaces about meaninglessness require revision. Finally, he explores&#x2014;with the help of Plato&#x2014;the wry paradoxes that threaten any uncompromising assertion that all assertion can be undermined by the spirit of irony. <br></p><p><b>Wayne C.

This book is for serious readers for whom previous accounts have been either too impressionistic or too limited in scope, and who wish to approach the original texts with perspective and critical understanding. <br>Although this is a first-rate work of scholarship, no previous training in philosophy is required of the reader. The topical treatment introduces not only the existentialist position on each topic but also supporting arguments, historical context, and the line of criticism adopted by contemporary philosophers who oppose the existentialist stand.

The lead story, "The Vampyre," has influenced generations of fantasy fiction writers. One of the first tales ever written in the romantic vampire genre, it was the result of a friendly writing competition that also yielded Mary Shelley's classic, <i>Frankenstein</i>. The story begins as a gentleman traveling in Greece falls in love with a local beauty. When she warns him about vampires, he scoffs at her fears &#x2014; until he's caught in the forest one night and finds someone at his throat.<br>This fiendishly good collection continues with Clemence Housman's "The Werewolf," in which a white-robed maiden with a thirst for blood encounters twin brothers &#x2014; and executes a diabolical plan. In Edward Bulwer-Lytton's "Monos and Daimonos," a reclusive young man goes to great lengths to rid himself of the odd character pursuing him...with horrifying results. Plus, there are four more equally thrilling tales, including the anonymous stories, "The Curse" and "The Victim."

Well, we know you're busy. After spending hours on end cramming Shakespeare into your head, we're positive that the last thing you want to do is stand in front of a hot stove stirring sauce or waiting for a pot of water to boil. And c'mon-a microwave is so much more accessible than a stove. Microwave in the student union or your dorm room? Check. Stovetop? Not so much.</p><p>Microwaved vegan food. Yum! Okay, we're not totally naive here-we know this probably conjures up an image of a bowl of nuked, wilted kale or some other oh-so-healthy (but possibly gag-inducing) green food. However, at PETA we're all about breaking stereotypes, so we've created a cookbook dedicated to vegan food that doesn't require a stove and tastes delicious.</p><p>College is supposed to be the time in your life when you're really figuring out how to fend for yourself. You're already trying to figure out physics and how to get out of going to your 8:00 a.m. class, so who has time to learn how to flambï¿½ or frappï¿½? Did you know you can actually make pasta without a pot or pancakes without a pan? Well, believe it, buddy. We can teach you all you need to know to make simple, effortless meals. You'll have plenty of time later on in life to make friends with your stove.</p><p>We're betting you've been there-nuking package after package of ramen. Opening the freezer with your fingers crossed, hoping there's a frozen burrito lurking behind the ice tray. Or gagging down some pizza, trying your hardest not to dwell on the fact that mold makes interesting shapes in a week-anything to put off actually spending time and effort cooking a meal.</p><p>That's where we come in.</p><p>Why didn't we make a cookbook that's just like every other one out there? Because we love being the black sheep, the lone wolf, the creep in the back corner. Okay, maybe not that last one, but you get the idea. We dare to be different, and we bet you are itchin' to do the same.</p><p><strong>HEADS UP</strong></p><p>So we know you are old enough and smart enough to know how to work a microwave safely, but we still worry!

Burns don't feel so hot. (Get it?)</p><p>ï¿½Although most plastic containers are microwave safe, please double-check before putting one in the microwave.

Beginning painters are given the basic tools and step-by-step demonstrations, intermediate painters are challenged with unpublished techniques that allow them to break through to the next level, and advanced painters learn to apply their skills under unified theories.<br><br><i>Landscapes in Oil </i>devotes a chapter to each of the fundamental elements of landscape painting--drawing, value, color, composition, and light quality--and offers critical advice on selecting tools and materials, choosing colors, and structuring your palette for best results. Emphasizing the necessity of plein air drawing and painting, Salaz demonstrates how to translate small, quick studies made outdoors into full-scale studio paintings. He provides detailed step-by-step breakdowns of the creation of four of his own paintings, focusing not only on application but also on the ideas that underpin every decision a landscape painter must make. The scores of landscape masterworks, past and present, that illustrate this book have been carefully chosen for their aesthetic power and because each embodies a specific aspect of the landscape painter's craft.<br><br>For Salaz, landscape painting is a noble pursuit, and the goal of the landscape artist is not to paint "pretty pictures" but to create compelling images that express human beings' profound connection to nature in all its diversity and grandeur. At a time when classical landscape is enjoying a renaissance in art schools, ateliers, and galleries across North America, this book is an essential resource for beginning and experienced painters alike.</p><p>Ken Salaz was born in 1970 in southern California and spent his youth living in numerous locations with his family including Mexico, the Southwest United States, and the Appalachian mountains. He spent several years traveling the world, through Asia, Central and South America, and Europe painting landscapes. He studied with Leonid Gervitz and Jacob Collins. His work and processes have been featured many times in notable magazines and publications such as <i>Fine Art Connoisseur</i> and his work was recently selected for the spring cover of <i>PleinAir</i> magazine. Mr. Salaz is seen by many as a new and unique voice emerging from a realistic tradition and yet is breaking new ground with his own modern interpretation of Poetic Realism. He is represented by several galleries including Reh's Gallery in New York City. In addition to being a masterful artist, Mr. Salaz is a highly accomplished magician, mentalist, and professional pick-pocket, entertaining such celebrities as Bruce Springstein and Jimmy Fallon. He currently lives with is wife Camie Salaz and their sons in the beautiful Hudson River Valley. For more about the artist visit www.kensalaz.com."Ken Salaz has produced a remarkably thorough book on landscape painting. He covers the foundation that every landscape painter needs to master: drawing, color, composition, perspective, atmosphere, illumination, field sketching, and studio painting. His explanations are clear and the diagrams and illustrations are helpful. This book will be a great help to young artists and professionals alike."<br><b>Jacob&nbsp;Collins</b></p><h2>Wives and Daughters (Oxford World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p><em>Wives and Daughters</em>, Elizabeth Gaskell's last novel, is regarded by many as her masterpiece. Molly Gibson is the daughter of the doctor in the small provincial town of Hollingford. Her widowed father marries a second time to give Molly the woman's presence he feels she lacks, but until the arrival of Cynthia, her dazzling step-sister, Molly finds her situation hard to accept. Intertwined with the story of the Gibsons is that of Squire Hamley and his two sons; as Molly grows up and falls in love she learns to judge people for what they are, not what they seem. Through Molly's observations the hierarchies, social values, and social changes of early nineteenth-century English life are made vivid in a novel that is timeless in its representation of human relationships. This edition, the first to be based in the original Cornhill Magazine serialization of 1864-6, draws on a full collation of the manuscript to present the most accurate text so far available.<br><br><strong>About the Series: </strong>For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics</strong> has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe. Each affordable volume reflects Oxford's commitment to scholarship, providing the most accurate text plus a wealth of other valuable features, including expert introductions by leading authorities, voluminous notes to clarify the text, up-to-date bibliographies for further study, and much more.<br></p><p>Set in English society before the 1832 Reform Bill, Wives and Daughters centres on the story of youthful Molly Gibson, brought up from childhood by her father. When he remarries, a new step-sister enters Molly&#39;s quiet life - loveable, but worldly and troubling, Cynthia. The narrative traces the development of the two girls into womanhood within the gossiping and watchful society of Hollingford. Wives and Daughters is far more than a nostalgic evocation of village life; it offers an ironic critique of mid-Victorian society. &#39;No nineteenth-century novel contains a more devastating rejection than this of the Victorian male assumption of moral authority&#39;, writes Pam Morris in her introduction to this new edition, in which she explores the novel&#39;s main themes - the role of women, Darwinism and the concept of Englishness - and its literary and social context.Mrs Elizabeth Gaskell (1810-1865) was a friend of Charlotte Bronte and Charles Dickens, who first accepted Cranford for publication in his magazine Household Words.</p><h2>Chinese Herbal Materia Medica</h2><p>Chinese Herbal Medicine: Materia Medica (Revised Edition) is an extensive sourcebook of information about the most commonly used substances in Chinese herbal medicine.

In this innovative book, Melani McAlister explores the cultural history of political interests, arguing that U.S. encounters with the Middle East were influenced by both the presence of oil and the religious symbolism of the region. McAlister's richly textured study shows how culture functions as a social and historical force in shaping politics and identity. She skillfully weaves lively and accessible readings of popular culture with a rigorous analysis of U.S. foreign policy and the domestic politics of race.<br><br>McAlister begins by situating the postwar development of U.S.&#x2013;Middle East relations, including the rise of anticolonialism and the establishment of the state of Israel. Subsequent chapters consider specific events and cultural texts such as the epic film <i>The Ten Commandments,</i> the King Tut museum exhibit, writings from the Black arts movement, the U.S.-Iranian hostage crisis, and the 1990&#x2013;1991 Gulf War. In each of these cases, McAlister demonstrates how representations of the Middle East have been a site of struggle over both the nature of U.S. foreign policy and the construction of race, religion, and gender within the United States.<br><br>Truly interdisciplinary, this work will appeal to a wide audience as it illuminates the significant intersection of culture and politics that is at the heart of both nationalism and globalization.</p><p>"A wonderfully original and compelling study, essential for understanding the complex relations between the US and the nations and peoples of the Mideast. McAlister argues powerfully that American interests in the Mideast range far beyond the realm of foreign policy to become of paramount importance to the creation of American culture in the post World War II era. . . . A model for those interested in the interconnections of culture and foreign policy in an era of globalization. An engrossing read." Amy Kaplan, author of <i>The Social Construction of American Realism</i><br><br>"Melani McAlister has written a marvelous book that draws together a vast array of materials from the media, archives, scholarly sources, and popular culture, interpreting it through her rich knowledge of cultural studies. Scholars in many fields--American studies, sociology, religious studies, political science, media studies, among others--will want to read this lively and engaging book." Robert Wuthnow, author of <i>After Heaven: Spirituality in America Since the 1950s,</i> and <i>Creative Spirituality: The Way of the Artist</i><br><br>"A fascinating and completely original analysis of the relation between culture and foreign policy. . . this book casts entirely new light on US military, financial, and emotional investments in the Middle East. Conservative Christian sensibilities, television, Biblical epics, Black Power, and a host of gender-related representations--these and other factors all played a part in the shaping of American foreign policy in ways that have never before been noticed. No historian of twentieth-century American culture or politics should miss this brilliant book!" Gail Bederman, author of <i>Manliness and Civilization: A Cultural History of Gender and Race in the US, 1880-1917</i><br><br>"Diplomatic historians are now turning to Edward Said&#x2019;s Orientalism to explore the cultural dimensions of 20th Century America&#x2019;s representations of the Middle East. They are too late! Melani McAlister develops a "post-orientalist" approach to U.S. culture, foreign policy, and identity. Hers is also the first book ever to recognize that African -Americans matter to such a project. <i>Epic Encounters</i> is a blockbuster of a book."

I can&#39;t turn a page without finding a jewel.&#34; Clifford Stoll, University of California, Berkeley, author of The Cuckoo&#39;s Egg &#34;The research that has gone into this book is impressive.&#34; Nature &#34;For professional physicists much of the value lies in the extensive technical appendices and footnotes, and the exhaustive list of references. But if, like me, you are a child at heart, the real fun lies in the zany stories and wild speculations.&#34; Physics World Time Machines explores the idea of time travel from the first account in English literature to the latest theories of physicists such as Kip Thorne and Igor Novikov. This very readable work covers a variety of topics including the history of time travel in fiction; the fundamental scientific concepts of time, spacetime, and the fourth dimension; the speculations of Einstein, Richard Feynman, Kurt Goedel, and others; time travel paradoxes, and much more.</p><p>From the foreword to the Second Edition, by Kip S. Thorne- &#34;It is now not only the most complete documentation of time travel in science fiction; it is also the most thorough review of serious scientific literature on the subject - a review that, remarkably is scientifically accurate and at the same time largely accessible to a broad audience of nonspecialists .... In browsing this revised edition, I have been struck by the richness and complexity of the tapestry of ideas that Nahin presents.... Nahin simply reports what he sees in the physics and science fiction literature, commenting lucidly and often pointedly on the interconnections, contradictions, and controversies, but leaving it to his readers to form their own final judgments.... Nahin&#39;s book, with its complex tapestry of ideas and possibilities, may well remain the most readable and complete treatise on time travel in science and science fiction.&#34;Time Machines: Time Travel in Physics, Metaphysics, and Science Fiction takes the reader on an exhilarating journey through the intriguing theories of scientists and the far-flung imaginations of writers. Readers will explore the ideas of time travel from the first account in English literature (Samuel Madden's 1733 Memoirs of the Twentieth Century) to the latest theories of physicists such as Kip Thorne and Igor Novikov. Time Machines is a completely accessible work for the nonspecialist general reader and covers a variety of topics including the history of time travel in fiction; the fundamental scientific concepts of time, spacetime, and the fourth dimension; the speculations of Einstein, Richard Feynman, Kurt Godel, and others; scientific hypotheses about the direction of time, reversed time, and multi-dimensional time; time travel paradoxes, and much more. -- <i>Midwest Book Review</i></p><h2>From Shakespeare to Existentialism</h2><p>Explores such themes as philosophy versus poetry, post-World War II German thought, art, tradition, and truth in a collection of essays.</p><p>"[It] is critics like Mr. Kaufmann who often prove the most stimulating to read the most memorable in their effect."<b>--<i>Observer</i><br> </b><br></p><h2>The Confederate War</h2><p>If one is to believe contemporary historians, the South never had a chance. Many allege that the Confederacy lost the Civil War because of internal division or civilian disaffection; others point to flawed military strategy or ambivalence over slavery. But, argues distinguished historian <b>Gary Gallagher</b>, we should not ask why the Confederacy collapsed so soon but rather how it lasted so long. In <i>The Confederate War</i> he reexamines the Confederate experience through the actions and words of the people who lived it to show how the home front responded to the war, endured great hardships, and assembled armies that fought with tremendous spirit and determination. Gallagher&#x2019;s portrait highlights a powerful sense of Confederate patriotism and unity in the face of a determined adversary. Drawing on letters, diaries, and newspapers of the day, he shows that Southerners held not only an unflagging belief in their way of life, which sustained them to the bitter end, but also a widespread expectation of victory and a strong popular will closely attuned to military events. In fact, the army&#x2019;s &#x201c;offensive-defensive&#x201d; strategy came remarkably close to triumph, claims Gallagher&#x2015;in contrast to the many historians who believe that a more purely defensive strategy or a guerrilla resistance could have won the war for the South. To understand why the South lost, Gallagher says we need look no further than the war itself: after a long struggle that brought enormous loss of life and property, Southerners finally realized that they had been beaten on the battlefield. Gallagher&#x2019;s interpretation of the Confederates and their cause boldly challenges current historical thinking and invites readers to reconsider their own conceptions of the American Civil War.</p><p>[Gallagher&#39;s] perceptive and engaging new book maintains that historians have got off track in recent years by attributing Confederate defeat to weakness on the home front rather than to performance on the battlefield. War-weariness, lack of will and ambivalence toward the cause of independence, they say, doomed the South ... Gallagher addresses the right issues, asks probing questions and suggests intriguing alternatives.-Daniel E. Sutherland, New York Times Book ReviewGary W. Gallagher is John L.

Author Jane Hamilton leads us through the arid life of Ruth Grey, who extracts what small pleasures and graces she can from a tiny Illinois town and the broken people who inhabit it. Ruth's prime tormentor is her mother May, whose husband died in World War II and took her future with him. More poor familial luck has given Ruth a brother who is a math prodigy; Matt sucks up any stray attention like a black hole. Ruth is left to survive on her own resources, which are meager. She struggles along, subsisting on crumbs of affection meted out by her Aunt Sid and, later, her screwed-up husband Ruby. Hamilton has perfect pitch. So perfect that you wince with pain for confused but fundamentally good Ruth as she walks a dead-end path. The book ends with the prospect of redemption, thank goodness--but the tale is nevertheless much more bitter than sweet."An extraordinary story of a family's disintegration...

Robots can climb stairs, open doors, win <i>Jeopardy</i>, analyze stocks, work in factories, find parking spaces, advise oncologists. In the past, automation was considered a threat to low-skilled labor. Now, many high-skilled functions, including interpreting medical images, doing legal research, and analyzing data, are within the skill sets of machines. How can higher education prepare students for their professional lives when professions themselves are disappearing? In <i>Robot-Proof,</i> Northeastern University president Joseph Aoun proposes a way to educate the next generation of college students to invent, to create, and to discover&#x2015;to fill needs in society that even the most sophisticated artificial intelligence agent cannot.</p><p>A &#x201c;robot-proof&#x201d; education, Aoun argues, is not concerned solely with topping up students' minds with high-octane facts. Rather, it calibrates them with a creative mindset and the mental elasticity to invent, discover, or create something valuable to society&#x2015;a scientific proof, a hip-hop recording, a web comic, a cure for cancer. Aoun lays out the framework for a new discipline, humanics, which builds on our innate strengths and prepares students to compete in a labor market in which smart machines work alongside human professionals. The new literacies of Aoun's humanics are <i>data literacy</i>, <i>technological literacy,</i> and <i>human literacy</i>. Students will need data literacy to manage the flow of big data, and technological literacy to know how their machines work, but human literacy&#x2015;the humanities, communication, and design&#x2015;to function as a human being. Life-long learning opportunities will support their ability to adapt to change.</p><p>The only certainty about the future is change.

The magical phrase appears a second time, and now Tom, having fallen out of the pot, is lifeless again, and Mary finds herself back in her room wondering if it was all a dream. The third time the phrase appears, Mary is visiting her granny and looks over a hollyhock wall into the garden next door. Tom is there to welcome her and the two children play. Here, the book abruptly ends. Readers are left to wonder about the source of the magic and whether Mary will have to stay in the garden. Or is it all a dream? The richly detailed illustrations may interest readers more than the story, which doesn't measure up to Waddell's well-loved earlier books.<br><i>Virginia Golodetz, Children's Literature New England, Burlington, VT </i><br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.Real and imaginary elements overlap in a confusing mishmash in Waddell's (Good Job, Little Bear) tale of a girl who starts a garden in a cooking pot. When the seeds Mary plants sprout into tiny trees, she adds a piece of blue ribbon to serve as a stream and builds a bridge out of matchsticks, then paints flowers on the outside of the pot to create a "hollyhock wall." Next she shapes a clay figure whom she names Tom. That night, explains the author in overblown prose, "somehow, some strange how, something strange happened...."Athe first of several such refrains. Suddenly Mary finds herself within her lush garden, where Tom is now a living, breathing boy. The plot straddles reality and unreality as Tom returns to clay, then later becomes human once againAwith no apparent logicAand Mary comes and goes from the garden. Mavor's (The Way Home) inventive and fetching fabric-relief art provides a more compelling juxtaposition of the actual and the fanciful. Her intricate tableaux of appliqu?, embroidery and soft sculpture incorporate live flowers and greenery, miniature objects and pieces of lace and ribbon to create a startlingly convincing three-dimensional effect. Yet even the artwork fails to orient readers on this bewildering outing. Ages 4-8.

Baron Raimund von Stillfried was the most important foreign-born photographer of the Meiji era and one of the first globally active photographers of his generation. He played a key role in the international image of Japan and the adoption of photography within Japanese society itself. Yet, the lack of a thorough study of his activities, travels, and work has been a fundamental gap in both Japanese- and Western-language scholarship. Based on extensive new primary sources and unpublished documents from archives around the world, this book examines von Stillfried's significance as a cultural mediator between Japan and Central Europe. It highlights the tensions and fierce competition that underpinned the globalising photographic industry at a site of cultural contact and exchange - treaty-port Yokohama. In the process, it raises key questions for Japanese visual culture, Habsburg studies, and cross-cultural histories of photography and globalisation.<br><br><i>A Career of Japan</i> is the winner of the 2nd Professor Josef Kreiner Hosei University Award for International Studies (Kreiner Award).<br><br>"Luke Gartlan's book is a compelling and enjoyable read, and contributes major new perspectives to the growing field of Meiji photography. It will certainly be the authoritative work on Raimund von Stillfried, but it is also impressive for its contributions to other important areas of Meiji cultural studies, including representations of the emperor, photography of Hokkaido, and world's fairs." Bert Winther-Tamaki (University of California, Irvine)<br><br></p><p>Luke Gartlan (PhD 2004) is a lecturer at the School of Art History, University of St Andrews. He is the editor of the peer-reviewed international quarterly <i>History of Photography</i>, and co-editor, with Ali Behdad, of <i>Photography's Orientalism: New Essays on Colonial Representation</i> (Getty Research Institute, 2013). His research concerns photography and cultural exchange in the nineteenth century, especially with reference to the camera&#x2019;s role in colonial-era visual culture, histories of travel and exploration, and non-Western responses to photography.Gartlan's exploration of Raimund von Stillfried's prolific artistic activities makes a compelling contribution to the study of Japanese visual culture [...] The work transcends traditional art-historical boundaries. Kerry Ross in <i>Monumenta Nipponica</i> 73:1 (2018), pp. 107-110. <br><br> Luke Gartlan's <i>A Career of Japan</i> is that rare book that combines erudition, style, a compelling story, impeccable research, and commitment to innovative historical and cultural studies. [...] It is also a showpiece of a beautifully produced book, with impressive reproductions [...] and a fantastic layout. [...] Gartlan's dense weave teaches us much about orientalism and globalization - we all need to read it and learn new ways of approaching visual culture and cultural contact. Katherine Arens in <i>Journal of Austrian Studies</i>, Vol. 51, No. 2, Summer 2018, pp. 91-93. <br><br> "Gartlan has skilfully pieced together a substantial body of source material [...] from across Japan, Austria, the UK and Australia to craft a compelling account of Stillfried's international adventures and misadventures. Gartlan's enthusiasm for his subject is infectious. [...] Given the preference of so many publishers to strip away valuable elements of scholarly publications such as appendices, glossaries, extensive endnotes and colour illustrations in the name of cutting costs and broadening the audience, books like this one have become rare gems indeed. Brill is to be heartily congratulated for valuing Gartlan's contribution, respecting the importance of scholarly rigour and celebrating the appeal of Stillfried's imagery.<br>The result is a beautifully presented, lavishly illustrated and fascinating book that promises to be enjoyed by readers interested in Japanese studies, history, modernism, tourism studies and photography." Melissa Miles in <i>Japan Forum</i> 2017. <br><br> "Long recognized as the authority on Stillfried, Gartlan has pulled together his extensive research in this thorough and engaging study. (...) One of the many strengths of the Gartlan's book is in how he provides interesting details, many of which were previously unknown (...) Gartlan has included relevant and previously unknown documents in the book's appendices (...)The impressive format of the book (7.5 by 10 inches) makes it possible to have large reproductions; these are all beautifully printed in color, so one can appreciate the aesthetics of Stillfried's hand-colored albumen prints. (...) Gartlan's important and fascinating book will be a hard act to follow." - Eleanor M. Hight, in: <i>Trans Asia Photography Review</i> 6/2 (Spring 2016) <br><br> "The eminent Dutch publishing-house of Brill must be commended for the look and feel of this book, printed on high-quality glossy paper and its superbly-reproduced photographs, many of which are colored, like the one described above. The book is the first volume in a projected series entitled "Photography in Asia," and if this one is anything to go by, this reviewer is certainly looking forward to further volumes. Beautiful books are hard to find these days, and Brill should be congratulated for producing this one. [...] I've already said something about the production of this book; Brill has done a great service to both the author and his subject. The book is a pleasure to hold, to look at, and to read. Gartlan has rescued a great artist from comparative oblivion, and I only wish that I could do the technical aspects of this book the justice they deserve. I cannot recommend it more highly, both for the visual treats and the intellectual delights in the discussion." - John Butler, in: <i>Asia Review of Books</i>, 7 August 2016 [Full review] <br><br> "Gartlan's richly detailed but highly readable text covers Stillfried's life in Europe, his minor successes abroad in the 1860s as well as his acclaimed but mixed economic success as a photographer in Yokohama. (...) <i>A Career of Japan</i> is well laid out and illustrated and makes a number of rare documents accessible through appendices. (...) This publication will be a key reference work on the artist, the period and the phenomenon of 19th-20th century <i>Japonisme</i> in the west." - Gael Newton, in: <i> TAASA Review</i> 25/3<br>"a work of great quality, printed on good paper with excellent reproductions of the photographs.

The book develops calculus, as well as the necessary trigonometry and analytic geometry, from witin the relevant historical context, and yet it is not a textbook in the history of mathematics as such.

With chapter titles like "A Dysfunctional Family," you know exactly what to expect--but Stewart is such a big, fat target that the book is entertaining anyway. Obviously, the architect of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia is no sweetheart. (Control issues? You don't say). But regardless of the muck, you'll come away with a mixture of respect for Stewart's talent and prodigious drive ("I can will an orgasm whenever I want"), and profound gratitude that she's not your daughter, wife, mother, friend, or business associate. <i>Just Desserts</i> affords brief glimpses of the private Martha. She was called "Marty" in high school. She modeled her way through Barnard. She may have engaged in wife-swapping. But anyone surprised that Martha the domestic goddess is a work of fiction misses the point entirely.Jerry Oppenheimer has written bestselling biographies of other American icons, including Bill and Hillary Clinton (<i>State of a Union</i>), Martha Stewart (<i>Just Desserts</i>), Ethel Kennedy (<i>The Other Mrs. Kennedy</i>), Barbara Walters (<i>Barbara Walters: An Unauthorized Biography</i>), and Rock Hudson (<i>Idol: The True Story of an American Film Hero</i>).<p></p></p><h2>Mega-Projects: The Changing Politics of Urban Public Investment</h2><p><br><p>Since the demise of urban renewal in the early 1970s, the politics of large-scale public investment in and around major American cities has received little scholarly attention. In MEGA-PROJECTS, Alan Altshuler and David Luberoff analyze the unprecedented wave of large-scale (mega-) public investments that occurred in American cities during the 1950s and 1960s; the social upheavals they triggered, which derailed large numbers of projects during the late 1960s and early 1970s; and the political impulses that have shaped a new generation of urban mega-projects in the decades since. They also appraise the most important consequences of policy shifts over this half-century and draw out common themes from the rich variety of programmatic and project developments that they chronicle. The authors integrate narratives of national as well as state and local policymaking, and of mobilization by (mainly local) project advocates, with a profound examination of how well leading theories of urban politics explain the observed realities. The specific cases they analyze include a wide mix of transportation and downtown revitalization projects, drawn from numerous regions&#x2014;most notably Boston, Denver, Los Angeles, New York City, Chicago, Atlanta, Dallas, Portland, and Seattle. While their original research focuses on highway, airport, and rail transit programs and projects, they draw as well on the work of others to analyze the politics of public investment in urban renewal, downtown retailing, convention centers, and professional sports facilities. In comparing their findings with leading theories of urban and American politics, Altshuler and Luberoff arrive at some surprising findings about which perform best and also reveal some important gaps in the literature as a whole. In a concluding chapter, they examine the potential effects of new fiscal pressures, business mobilization to relax environmental constraints, and security concerns in the wake of September 11. And they make clear their own views about how best to achieve a balance between developmental, environmental, and democratic values in public investment decisionmaking. Integrating fifty years of urban development history with leading theories of urban and American politics, MEGA-PROJECTS provides significant new insights into urban and intergovernmental politics. </p><br></p><p><p><b>Alan Altshuler</b> is the Ruth and Frank Stanton Professor of Urban Policy at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government and its Graduate School of Design.

If they fall behind or fail at this point, they are unlikely to recover and to pursue a career in the sciences or other mathematics-dependent occupations. The authors reveal at least two of the reasons for this watershed experience. First, the content itself is much more complex than that at the primary grades, a complexity that is only now being fully appreciated. Second, conventional instruction often is based on faulty assumptions about the way in which the content is learned.<br> <br> The chapters present the latest understanding of the nature of the mathematics content in the middle grades and the processes by which it is learned.<br></p><p></p><h2>A Hero of Our Time (with an Introduction by George Reavey)</h2><p>Mikhail Lermontov&#x2019;s pioneering psychological novel, &#x201c;A Hero of Our Time&#x201d;, is probably his most impactful work, one which influenced the works of other great Russian authors such as Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy. The novel&#x2019;s narrative is the story of Pechorin a young officer in the army whose story is told in five non-chronological parts. Drawing upon his own experiences in the military, Lermontov creates a fascinating anti-hero in Pechorin, a man who is intelligent, calculating, manipulative, emotionally unavailable, arrogant, cynical, nihilistic, yet also sensitive. The principal accomplishment of &#x201c;A Hero of Our Time&#x201d; is the introduction of the Byronic anti-hero to Russian literature, a departure from the traditional idealized protagonist of the Romantic period which signifies a pivotal move towards the realism of the Modernist literary movement. As Lermontov describes in his preface: &#x201c;A Hero of Our Time, my dear readers, is indeed a portrait, but not of one man. It is a portrait built up of all our generation&#x2019;s vices in full bloom. You will again tell me that a human being cannot be so wicked, and I will reply that if you can believe in the existence of all the villains of tragedy and romance, why wouldn&#x2019;t believe that there was a Pechorin?&#x201d; This edition is printed on premium acid-free paper and includes an introduction by George Reavey.</p><p>Mikhail Yuryevich Lermontov (1814-1841), sometimes called &#34;the poet of the Caucasus,&#34; was the most important Russian poet after Alexander Pushkin&#39;s death. His influence on later Russian literature is still felt in modern times, not only through his poetry, but also by his prose. His poetry remains popular in Chechnya, Dagestan, and beyond Russia.</p><h2>The Happy Prince &amp; Other Stories (Wordsworth Children's Classics)</h2><p>In these delightful tales, Oscar Wilde employs all his grace, artistry and wit. The Happy Prince tells of the statue of a once pleasure-loving Prince which, with the help of a selfless Swallow helps people in distress. As well as The Nightingale and the Rose, The Devoted Friend and The Remarkable Rocket, this collection contains The Selfish Giant, a remarkable story of the redemptive power of love.</p><p>Ilustrated by Charled RobinsonOscar Wilde was born on October 16, 1854, to the Irish nationalist and writer Speranza Wilde and the doctor William Wilde. After graduating from Oxford in 1878, Wilde moved to London, where he became notorious for his sharp wit and flamboyant style of dress. <br><br>Though he was publishing plays and poems throughout the 1880s, it wasn t until the late 1880s and early 1890s that his work started to be received positively. In 1895, Oscar Wilde was tried for homosexuality and was convicted and sentenced to two years in prison. Tragically, this downfall came at the height of his career, as his plays, An Ideal Husband "and The Importance of Being Earnest, "were playing to full houses in London. He was greatly weakened by the privations of prison life, and moved to Paris after his sentence. Wilde died in a hotel room, either of syphilis or complications from ear surgery, in Paris, on November 30, 1900.</p><h2>Germany 1866-1945 (Oxford History of Modern Europe)</h2><p>Some wear creasing to cover.

In short, Polsby argues that air conditioning altered the demography of the southern states, which in turn changed the political parties of the South, which transformed the composition and in due course the performance of the US House of Representatives. This evolutionary process led to the House's liberalization and later to its transformation into an arena of sharp partisanship, visible among both Democrats and Republicans. <em>How Congress Evolves</em> breathes new life into the dusty corners of institutional history, and offers a unique explanation for important transformations in the congressional environment.<br><br></p><p><br><strong>Nelson Polsby</strong> is Heller Professor of Political Science at the University of California, Berkeley where he has taught American politics and government since 1967.

In his own lifetime, Franklin knew prominence not only in America but also in Britain and France. Here was a cosmopolitan statesman, public servant, inventor, and editor with a distinctly Yankee sensibility; here was a moral philosopher who divided his faith between the natural sciences and the American experiment. This volume includes Franklin's reflections on such diverse issues as reason and religion, social status, electricity, America's national character and characters, war, and the societal status of women. Also included is a new transcription of his 1726 journal, and several pieces that have only recently been identified as Franklin's work.</p><p>Ormond Seavey is at The George Washington University, Washington, DC.<i>Part One<br>Twyford, at the Bishop of St. Asaph's, 1771.</i><br><br>Dear son:<br>I have ever had pleasure in obtaining any little anecdotes of my ancestors. You may remember the inquiries I made among the remains of my relations when you were with me in England, and the journey I undertook for that purpose. Imagining it may be equally agreeable to you to know the circumstances of my life, many of which you are yet unacquainted with, and expecting the enjoyment of a week's uninterrupted leisure in my present country retirement, I sit down to write them for you. To which I have besides some other inducements. Having emerged from the poverty and obscurity in which I was born and bred, to a state of affluence and some degree of reputation in the world, and having gone so far through life with a considerable share of felicity, the conducing means I made use of, which with the blessing of God so well succeeded, my posterity may like to know, as they may find some of them suitable to their own situations, and therefore fit to be imitated.<br><br>That felicity, when I reflected on it, has induced me sometimes to say, that were it offered to my choice, I should have no objection to a repetition of the same life from its beginning, only asking the advantages authors have in a second edition to correct some faults of the first. So I might, besides correcting the faults, change some sinister accidents and events of it for others more favorable. But though this were denied, I should still accept the offer. Since such a repetition is not to be expected, the next thing most like living one's life over again seems to be a recollection of that life, and to make that recollection as durable as possible by putting it down in writing.<br><br>Hereby, too, I shall indulge the inclination so natural in old men, to be talking of themselves and their own past actions; and I shall indulge it without being tiresome to others, who, through respect to age, might conceive themselves obliged to give me a hearing, since this may be read or not as any one pleases. And, lastly (I may as well confess it, since my denial of it will be believed by nobody), perhaps I shall a good deal gratify my own vanity. Indeed, I scarce ever heard or saw the introductory words, Without vanity I may say, etc., but some vain thing immediately followed. Most people dislike vanity in others, whatever share they have of it themselves; but I give it fair quarter wherever I meet with it, being persuaded that it is often productive of good to the possessor, and to others that are within his sphere of action; and therefore, in many cases, it would not be altogether absurd if a man were to thank God for his vanity among the other comforts of life.<br><br>And now I speak of thanking God, I desire with all humility to acknowledge that I owe the mentioned happiness of my past life to His kind providence, which led me to the means I used and gave them success. My belief of this induces me to hope, though I must not presume, that the same goodness will still be exercised toward me, in continuing that happiness, or enabling me to bear a fatal reverse, which I may experience as others have done; the complexion of my future fortune being known to Him only in whose power it is to bless to us even our afflictions.<br><br>The notes of one of my uncles (who had the same kind of curiosity in collecting family anecdotes) once put into my hands furnished me with several particulars relating to our ancestors. From these notes I learned that the family had lived in the same village, Ecton, in Northamptonshire, for three hundred years, and how much longer he knew not (perhaps from the time when the name of Franklin, that before was the name of an order of people, was assumed by them as a surname when others took surnames all over the kingdom),* on a freehold of about thirty acres, aided by the smith's business, which had continued in the family till his time, the eldest son being always bred to that business, a custom which he and my father followed as to their eldest sons. When I searched the registers at Ecton, I found an account of their births, marriages, and burials, from the year 1555 only, there being no registers kept in that parish at any time preceding. By that register, I perceived that I was the youngest son of the youngest son for five generations back. My grandfather Thomas, who was born in 1598, lived at Ecton till he grew too old to follow business longer, when he went to live with his son John, a dyer at Banbury, in Oxfordshire, with whom my father served an apprenticeship. There my grandfather died and lies buried. We saw his gravestone in 1758. His eldest son Thomas lived in the house at Ecton, and left it with the land to his only child, a daughter, who, with her husband, one Richard Fisher, of Wellingborough, sold it to Mr. Isted, now lord of the manor there. My grandfather had four sons that grew up, viz.: Thomas, John, Benjamin, and Josiah. I will give you what account I can of them at this distance from my papers, and if these are not lost in my absence, you will among them find many more particulars.<br><br>Thomas was bred a smith under his father, but being ingenious, and encouraged in learning (as all my brothers were) by an Esquire Palmer, then the principal gentleman in that parish, he qualified himself for the business of scrivener,* became a considerable man in the county, was a chief mover of all public-spirited undertakings for the county or town of Northampton, and his own village, of which many instances were related of him, and much taken notice of and patronized by the then Lord Halifax. He died in 1702, January 6, old style, just four years to a day before I was born. The account we received of his life and character from some old people at Ecton, I remember, struck you as something extraordinary, from its similarity to what you knew of mine. "Had he died on the same day," you said, "one might have supposed a transmigration."<br><br>John was bred a dyer, I believe, of woolens. Benjamin was bred a silk dyer, serving an apprenticeship at London. He was an ingenious man. I remember him well, for, when I was a boy, he came over to my father in Boston, and lived in the house with us some years. He lived to a great age. His grandson, Samuel Franklin, now lives in Boston. He left behind him two quarto volumes. MS., of his own poetry, consisting of little occasional pieces addressed to his friends and relations, of which the following, sent to me, is a specimen.* He had formed a shorthand of his own, which he taught me, but, never practicing it, I have now forgot it. I was named after this uncle, there being a particular affection between him and my father. He was very pious, a great attender of sermons of the best preachers, which he took down in his shorthand, and had with him many volumes of them. He was also much of a politician; too much, perhaps, for his station. There fell lately into my hands in London a collection he had made of all the principal pamphlets relating to public affairs, from 1641 to 1717; many of the volumes are wanting, as appears by the numbering, but there still remain eight volumes in folio, and twenty-four in quarto and in octavo. A dealer in old books met with them, and knowing me by my sometimes buying of him, he brought them to me. It seems my uncle must have left them here when he went to America, which was above fifty years since. There are many of his notes in the margins.<br><br>This obscure family of ours was early in the Reformation, and continued Protestants through the reign of Queen Mary, when they were sometimes in danger of trouble on account of their zeal against popery. They had got an English Bible, and to conceal and secure it, it was fastened open with tapes under and within the cover of a joint-stool.* When my great-great-grandfather read it to his family, he turned up the joint-stool upon his knees, turning over the leaves then under the tapes. One of the children stood at the door to give notice if he saw the apparitor coming, who was an officer of the spiritual court. In that case the stool was turned down again upon its feet, when the Bible remained concealed under it as before. This anecdote I had from my uncle Benjamin. The family continued all of the Church of England till about the end of Charles the Second's reign, when some of the ministers that had been outed for nonconformity, holding conventicles* in Northamptonshire, Benjamin and Josiah adhered to them, and so continued all their lives: the rest of the family remained with the Episcopal Church.<br><br>Josiah, my father, married young, and carried his wife with three children into New England, about 1682. The conventicles having been forbidden by law, and frequently disturbed, induced some considerable men of his acquaintance to remove to that country, and he was prevailed with to accompany them thither, where they expected to enjoy their mode of religion with freedom. By the same wife he had four children more; born there, and by a second wife ten more, in all seventeen; of which I remember thirteen sitting at one time at his table, who all grew up to be men and women, and married; I was the youngest son, and the youngest child but two, and was born in Boston, New England. My mother, the second wife, was Abiah Folger, daughter of Peter Folger, one of the first settlers of New England, of whom honorable mention is made by Cotton Mather, in his church history of that country entitled Magnalia Christi Americana, as "a godly, learned Englishman," if I remember the words rightly. I have heard that he wrote sundry small occasional pieces, but only one of them was printed, which I saw now many years since. It was written in 1675, in the homespun verse of that time and people, and addressed to those then concerned in the government there. It was in favor of liberty of conscience, and in behalf of the Baptists, Quakers, and other sectaries that had been under persecution, ascribing the Indian wars, and other distresses that had befallen the country, to that persecution, as so many judgments of God to punish so heinous an offense, and exhorting a repeal of those uncharitable laws. The whole appeared to me as written with a good deal of decent plainness and manly freedom. The six concluding lines I remember, though I have forgotten the two first of the stanza; but the purport of them was, that his censures proceeded from good will, and therefore he would be known to be the author.<br>Because to be a libeler (says he)<br>I hate it with my heart;<br>From Sherburne town,* where now I dwell<br>My name I do put here;<br>Without offense your real friend,<br>It is Peter Folgier.<br>My elder brothers were all put apprentices to different trades. I was put to the grammar school at eight years of age, my father intending to devote me, as the tithe of his sons, to the service of the Church. My early readiness in learning to read (which must have been very early, as I do not remember when I could not read), and the opinion of all his friends, that I should certainly make a good scholar, encouraged him in this purpose of his. My uncle Benjamin, too, approved of it, and proposed to give me all his shorthand volumes of sermons, I suppose as a stock to set up with, if I would learn his character.&nbsp; I continued, however, at the grammar school not quite one year, though in that time I had risen gradually from the middle of the class of that year to be the head of it, and further was removed into the next class above it, in order to go with that into the third at the end of the year. But my father, in the meantime, from a view of the expense of a college education, which having so large a family he could not well afford, and the mean living many so educated were afterward able to obtain&#x2014;reasons that he gave to his friends in my hearing&#x2014;altered his first intention, took me from the grammar school, and sent me to a school for writing and arithmetic, kept by a then famous man, Mr. George Brownell, very successful in his profession generally, and that by mild, encouraging methods. Under him I acquired fair writing pretty soon, but I failed in the arithmetic, and made no progress in it. At ten years old I was taken home to assist my father in his business, which was that of a tallow chandler and soap boiler; a business he was not bred to, but had assumed on his arrival in New England, and on finding his dying trade would not maintain his family, being in little request. Accordingly, I was employed in cutting wick for the candles, filling the dipping mold and the molds for cast candles, attending the shop, going of errands, etc.<br><br>I disliked the trade, and had a strong inclination for the sea, but my father declared against it; however, living near the water, I was much in and about it, learned early to swim well, and to manage boats; and when in a boat or canoe with other boys, I was commonly allowed to govern, especially in any case of difficulty; and upon other occasions I was generally a leader among the boys, and sometimes led them into scrapes, of which I will mention one instance, as it shows an early projecting public spirit, though not then justly conducted.<br><br>There was a salt marsh that bounded part of the millpond, on the edge of which, at high water, we used to stand to fish for minnows. By much trampling, we had made it a mere quagmire. My proposal was to build a wharf there fit for us to stand upon, and I showed my comrades a large heap of stones, which were intended for a new house near the marsh, and which would very well suit our purpose. Accordingly, in the evening, when the workmen were gone, I assembled a number of my playfellows, and working with them diligently like so many emmets,* sometimes two or three to a stone, we brought them all away and built our little wharf. The next morning the workmen were surprised at missing the stones, which were found in our wharf. Inquiry was made after the removers; we were discovered and complained of; several of us were corrected by our fathers; and, though I pleaded the usefulness of the work, mine convinced me that nothing was useful which was not honest.</p><h2>The C++ Programming Language</h2><p>The C++ Programming Language, Third Edition Bjarne Stroustrup Preface Programming is understanding. - Kristen Nygaard I find using C++ more enjoyable than ever. C++&#39;s support for design and programming has improved dramatically over the years, and lots of new helpful techniques have been developed for its use. However, C++ is not justfun. Ordinary practical programmers have achieved significant improvements in productivity, maintainability, flexibility, and quality in projects of just about any kind and scale. By now, C++ has fulfilled most of the hopes I originally had for it, and also succeeded at tasks I hadn&#39;t even dreamt of. This book introduces standard C++* and the key programming and design techniques supported by C++. Standard C++ is a far more powerful and polished language than the version of C++ introduced by the first edition of this book. New language features such as name spaces, exceptions, templates, and run-time type identification allow many techniques to be applied more directly than was possible before, and the standard library allows the programmer to start from a much higher level than the bare language. About a third of the information in the second edition of this book came from the first. This third edition is the result of a rewrite of even larger magnitude. It offers something to even the most experienced C++ programmer; at the same time, this book is easier for the novice to approach that its predecessors were. The explosion of C++ use and the massive amount of experience accumulated as a result makes this possible. The definition of an extensive standard library makes a difference to the way C++ concepts can be presented. As before, this book presents C++ independently of any particular implementation, and as before, the tutorial chapters present language constructs and concepts in a &#34;bottom up&#34; order so that a construct is used only after it has been defined. However, it is much easier to use a well-designed library than it is to understand the details of its implementation. Therefore the standard library can be used to provide realistic and interesting examples well before a reader can be assumed to understand its inner workings. the standard library itself is also a fertile source of programming examples and design techniques. This book presents every major C++ language feature and the standard library. It is organized around language and library facilities. However, features are presented in the context of their use. That is, the focus is on the language as the tool for design and programming rather than on the language in itself. This book demonstrates key techniques that make C++ effective and teaches the fundamental concepts necessary for mastery. Except where illustrating technicalities, examples are taken from the domain of systems software. A companion, The Annotated C++ Language Standard, presents the complete language definition together with annotations to make it more comprehensible. The primary aim of this book is to help the reader understand how the facilities offered by C++ support key programming techniques. The aim is to take the reader far beyond the point where he or she gets code running primarily by copying examples and emulation programming styles from other languages. Only a good understanding of the ideas behind the language facilities leads to mastery. Supplemented by implementation documentation, the information provided is sufficient for completing significant real-world projects. The hope is that this book will help the reader gain new insights and become a better programmer and designer. Acknowledgements In addition to the people mentioned in the acknowledgment section of the first and second editions, I would like to thank Matt Austern, Hans Boehm, Don Caldwell, Lawrence Crowl, Alan Feuer, Andrew Forrest, Tim Griffin, Peter Juhl, Brian Kernighan, Andrew Koenig, Mike Mowbray, Rob Murray, Lee Nackman, Joseph Newcomer, Alex Stepanov, David Vandevoorde, Peter Weinberger, and Chris Van Wyk for commenting on draft chapters of this third edition. I would also like to thank the volunteers on the C++ standards committees who did an immense amount of constructive work to make C++ what it is today. It is slightly unfair to single out individuals, but it would be even more unfair not to mention anyone, so I&#39;d like to especially mention Mike Ball, Dag Bruck, Sean Corfield, Ted Goldstein, Kim Knutilla, Andrew Koenig, Josee Lajoie, Dmitry Lenkov, Nathan Myers, Martin O&#39;Riordan, Tom Plum, Jonathan Shopiro, John Spicer, Jerry Schwarz, Alex Stepanov, and Mike Vilot, as people who each directly cooperated with me over some part of C++ and its standard library. Bjarne Stroustrup Murray Hill, New Jersey *At the time of writing, the C++ Standard is still only a &#34;Final Committee Draft Standard.&#34; However, no significant changes to the language or the standard library are anticipated. 0201889544P04062001</p><p>In this brand-new third edition of <i>The C++ Programming Language</i>, author Bjarne Stroustrup, the creator of C++, presents the full specification for the C++ language and standard library, a spec that will soon become the joint ISO/ANSI C++ standard.<p> Past readers will find that the new edition has changed a great deal and grown considerably to encompass new language features, particularly run-time type identification, namespaces, and the standard library. At the same time, readers will recognize the lucid style and sensible advice that made previous editions so readable and enjoyable. Probably the biggest change is a substantial new section, well over 200 pages in length, covering the contents and design of the C++ standard library, the most important new feature of the C++ specification. The author has also added a substantial number of new exercises while keeping many from previous editions that have retained their value.</p><p> While <i>The C++ Programming Language</i> is not a C++ tutorial, strictly speaking, anyone learning the language, especially those coming from C, will greatly benefit from the clear presentation of all its elements.

The revised and updated Seventeenth Edition retains the book&#x2019;s long standing format and much of its prior materials, but it is updated to reflect recent events including all legislative developments, especially the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (Pub. L. 112-240). <p>The new edition contains coverage of revised tax rates, changes in the cost recovery system (ï¿½ï¿½ 179 and 168(k)), revised regulations on capitalization, extension of expiring tax provisions, restoration of indirect rate increases through the phase out of itemized deductions and personal exemptions, and the new Medicare tax on unearned income (ï¿½ 1411).<br></p></p><p></p><h2>The Horsecatcher (Bison Book)</h2><p>Praised for swift action and beauty of language, <i>The Horsecatcher</i> is Mari Sandoz's first novel about the Indians she knew so well. Without ever leaving the world of a Cheyenne tribe in the 1830s, she creates a youthful protagonist many readers will recognize in themselves. Young Elk is expected to be a warrior, but killing even an enemy sickens him. He would rather catch and tame the mustangs that run in herds. Sandoz makes it clear that his determination to be a horsecatcher will require a moral and physical courage equal to that of any warrior. And if he must earn the right to live as he wishes, he must also draw closer to family and community.</p><p>Mari Sandoz (1896-1966)."What gives this book stature . . . is Elk's quiet courage in defying tradition and finding his own place in his tribe and in life." -"New York Times"<br><br>"This is a moving novel. . . . There is a fine sense of place, the wide plains, the canyons, the brushy gullies; a deep insight into the life of the Cheyennes and their firm and understand-ing way with their young people." -"New York Herald Tribune Book Review"<br><br>"Mari Sandoz has written a beautiful story that is bright with warmth, humor, and love of life. It will provide rich and rewarding reading not only for older teens and young adults but also for grownups with a taste for uncomplicated goodness." -"Christian Science Monitor"</p><h2>The Handbook of Health Behavior Change</h2><p><p>This revised and updated fifth edition of the highly acclaimed &#x201c;gold standard&#x201d; textbook continues to provide a foundational review of health behavior change theories, research methodologies, and intervention strategies across a range of populations, age groups, and health conditions. It examines numerous, complex, and often co-occurring factors that can both positively and negatively influence people&#x2019;s ability to change behaviors to enhance their health including intrapersonal, interpersonal, sociocultural, environmental, systems, and policy factors, in the context of leading theoretical frameworks. Beyond understanding predictors and barriers to achieving meaningful health behavior change, the <i>Handbook</i> provides an updated review of the evidence base for novel and well-supported behavioral interventions and offers recommendations for future research.</p><p>New content includes chapters on Sun Protection, Interventions With the Family System, and the Role of Technology in Behavior Change.

Scattered reports of a mostly unexplored wilderness filled with natural wonders had caught the public&#x2019;s attention and the fifty-four-year-old Everts, near-sighted and an inexperienced woodsman, had determined to join the expedition. He was soon separated from the rest of the party&nbsp;and from his horse, setting him on a grueling quest for survival. For over a month he wandered Yellowstone alone and injured, with little food, clothing, or other equipment. In &#x201c;Thirty-seven Days of Peril&#x201d; he recounted his experiences for the readers of <i>Scribner&#x2019;s Monthly</i>.</p><p>In June 1996, Everts&#x2019;s granddaughter arrived at Mammoth Hot Springs in Yellowstone National Park to meet with park archivist Lee Whittlesey. She brought two documents that her father had kept hidden and both were handwritten by Everts. One was a brief autobiography that gave new insight into his early life. The other was a never-published alternative account of his confused 1870 journey through Yellowstone. Both have been added to this volume, further enhancing Everts&#x2019;s unlikely tale of survival.&nbsp;</p><br></p><p><p>Lee Whittlesey&nbsp;is the Yellowstone National Park historian and the author of multiple books on the park, including <i>Yellowstone Place Names </i>and <i>Storytelling in Yellowstone: Horse and Buggy Tour Guides</i>.</p><br><p>&#x201c;One of the most remarkable stories in early Yellowstone history.

At that time, like most flower growers in our country, we discovered cut flowers preserve their good appearance longer if kept in a vase with water rather than in dry storage. We then began intensive reading of various horticultural and other specialty journals, and we learned that many scientists had made the same disï¿½ covery long before and had gone even further, showing that sucrose and certain chemicals added to the vase water prolong the vase life of flowers much better than water alone. In the meantime, we learned that in the Netherlands, the United States, Israel, and elsewhere, great progress has been made in the postharvest treatment of flowers through the use of floral preservaï¿½ tives; grading, packing, and transportation procedures; and the organization of trade. In all these countries, researchers generously offered their information to growers, wholesalers, florists, and indiï¿½ vidual flower lovers eager to improve flower quality and keepability. We collected much of the practical information from various countries with the intention of using it in research projects conï¿½ cerning the postharvest physiology of floricultural commodities.</p><p>A practical handbook covering the plant handling cycle from grower to consumer. It is addressed specifically to commercial growers of floricultural crops, wholesale dealers, transportation companies, and retail florists, and presents solutions to reduce postharvest losses. A major feature of the book is a synopsis of particular crops and species and their handling requirements. Also included is information on the evaluation and grading of cut flowers.

J.G.A. Pocock suggests that Machiavelli's prime emphasis was on the moment in which the republic confronts the problem of its own instability in time, and which he calls the "Machiavellian moment."</p><p>After examining this problem in the thought of Machiavelli, Guicciardini, and Giannotti, Pocock turns to the revival of republican thought in Puritan England and in Revolutionary and Federalist America. He argues that the American Revolution can be considered the last great act of civic humanism of the Renaissance. He relates the origins of modern historicism to the clash between civic, Christian, and commercial values in the thought of the eighteenth century.</p></p><p><p>"<i>The Machiavellian Moment</i> raised a thousand issues, settled two or three, and gave historians and philosophers a generation's work. It is a must-read and a must-have."--<b>Philip Pettit, William Nelson Cromwell Professor of Politics, Princeton University</b></p> <p>"In analyzing the history of consciousness as explicated through philosophers, political theorists, historians, theologians, lawyers, and prophets, [this book] presents a new interpretation of wide-ranging problems.

Blending the fields of history, literature, music, psychology, and folklore, Huggins illuminates the thought and writing of such key figures as Alain Locke, James Weldon Johnson, and W.E.B. DuBois and provides sharp-eyed analyses of the poetry of Claude McKay, Countee Cullen, and Langston Hughes. But the main objective for Huggins, throughout the book, is always to achieve a better understanding of America as a whole. As Huggins himself noted, he didn't want Harlem in the 1920s to be the focus of the book so much as a lens through which readers might see how this one moment in time sheds light on the American character and culture, not just in Harlem but across the nation. He strives throughout to link the work of poets and novelists not only to artists working in other genres and media but also to economic, historical, and cultural forces in the culture at large.</p><p><br><strong>Nathan Irvin Huggins</strong> was W.E.B. Du Bois Professor of History and Afro-American Studies and Director of the Du Bois Institute at Harvard University until his death in 1989. His books include <em>Slave and Citizen: The Life of Frederick Douglass, Black Odyssey: The African-American Ordeal in Slavery</em>, and <em>Voices From the Harlem Renaissance</em>.<br><br>"A significant contribution to cultural history....Huggins amply demonstrates [that] black and white culture and self-image in America are inextricably linked as one."--Robert Sklar, <em>Journal of American History</em><p></p><br>"Still the most richly textured introduction to the diversity of voices in the Harlem Renaissance."--Susan Stanford Friedman, <em>University of Wisconsin at Madison</em><p></p><br>"One of the most important volumes of intellectual history ever written about the episode in African-American life in the twentieth century."--Lamont H.

A graduate of the Rhode Island School of Design, he has a strong background in design and art direction. He also has extensive experience in the world of educational publishing. Drawing on all these talents, Stuart J. Murphy brings a unique perspective to the MathStart series. In MathStart books, pictures do more than tell stories; they teach math.</p><p> Stuart J. Murphy and his wife, Nancy, live in Boston.</p>Murphy turns his considerable talents to the concept of classification in this MathStart title. When Josh receives a strange rock from his uncle, he consults an expert, shop owner Dave, to learn about his gift. He also notices the store's display window, which features stones arranged by size. As Josh's interest in and knowledge of geology grows, the window display changes, with the classification scheme becoming more complex--from size to color to type, and finally to hardness. Murphy's forte is explaining complex topics in a down-to-earth manner, and that's just what he's done here. Along the way, he also includes a good deal of information about rocks, minerals, and the scientific method. Smith's full-color illustrations capture the excitement of rock hunting and include many geological and equipment details. A good introduction to primary geology units or lessons on classification.

A distinguishing feature of video games is their interactivity, and sound plays an important role in this: a player&#39;s actions can trigger dialogue, sound effects, ambient sound, and music. And yet game sound has been neglected in the growing literature on game studies. This book fills that gap, introducing readers to the many complex aspects of game audio, from its development in early games to theoretical discussions of immersion and realism. In Game Sound, Karen Collins draws on a range of sources-including composers, sound designers, voice-over actors and other industry professionals, Internet articles, fan sites, industry conferences, magazines, patent documents, and, of course, the games themselves-to offer a broad overview of the history, theory, and production practice of video game audio. Game Sound has two underlying themes: how and why games are different from or similar to film or other linear audiovisual media; and technology and the constraints it has placed on the production of game audio. Collins focuses first on the historical development of game audio, from penny arcades through the rise of home games and the recent rapid developments in the industry. She then examines the production process for a contemporary game at a large game company, discussing the roles of composers, sound designers, voice talent, and audio programmers; considers the growing presence of licensed intellectual property (particularly popular music and films) in games; and explores the function of audio in games in theoretical terms. Finally, she discusses the difficulties posed by nonlinearity and interactivity for the composer of game music.</p><p>An examination of the many complex aspects of game audio, from the perspectives of both sound design and music composition."Collins has written a truly encyclopedic work that wonderfully complements books on sound design in film, helping anyone in the audiovisual industry who desires to expand more confidently into teaching, designing, and producing audio in the gaming world. This book provides fascinating insights about how game audio can enhance player involvement in story, environment, and character, with specific examples on creating a more immersive, interactive experience. A monumental contribution!"--David Sonnenschein, author of "Sound Design: The Expressive Power of Music, Voice, and Sound Effects in Cinema"<br><br>"Game Audio may sound to the uninitiated to be a frivolous pursuit, but it is neither simple nor trivial. "Game Sound" shows that this art/craft/business has an elegance and a freshly blossoming history that allow it to stand with dignity and legitimacy alongside any other human endeavor worthy of academic attention."--The Fat Man, George Alistair Sanger, Legendary Game Audio Guru</p><h2>The President&#39;s Kitchen Cabinet: The Story of the African Americans Who Have Fed Our First Families, from the Washingtons to the Obamas</h2><p>An NAACP Image Award Finalist for Outstanding Literary Work&#x2014;Non Fiction <p>James Beard award&#x2013;winning author Adrian Miller vividly tells the stories of the African Americans who worked in the presidential food service as chefs, personal cooks, butlers, stewards,and servers for every First Family since George and Martha Washington. Miller brings together the names and words of more than 150 black men and women who played remarkable roles in unforgettable events in the nation's history. Daisy McAfee Bonner, for example, FDR's cook at his Warm Springs retreat, described the president's final day on earth in 1945, when he was struck down just as his lunchtime cheese souffle emerged from the oven. Sorrowfully, but with a cook's pride, she recalled, "He never ate that souffle, but it never fell until the minute he died." <br><br>A treasury of information about cooking techniques and equipment, the book includes twenty recipes for which black chefs were celebrated. From Samuel Fraunces's "onions done in the Brazilian way" for George Washington to Zephyr Wright's popovers, beloved by LBJ's family, Miller highlights African Americans' contributions to our shared American foodways. Surveying the labor of enslaved people during the antebellum period and the gradual opening of employment after Emancipation, Miller highlights how food-related work slowly became professionalized and the important part African Americans played in that process. His chronicle of the daily table in the White House proclaims a fascinating new American story.<br><br></p></p><p>Adrian Miller--author of <i>Soul Food: The Surprising Story of an American Cuisine, One Plate at a Time</i>, which won a James Beard Foundation book award--worked as a special assistant to President Bill Clinton.

Highly evolved, it also exhibits special characteristics according to time and place. This book tells the story of the different generations of orchestral types, from the beginnings of the classical orchestra of Haydn to the mechanistic orchestra of Stravinsky and Schoenberg.</strong></p><p>Each period of orchestral history had its own ideal of sound, and it was not the creative musician alone but also the audience he wrote for who together determined the ideal of the time. The author points out the particular conditions from which the ideal grew and he marks the connections between ideals of different epochs, showing in what ways they were related and in what ways independent of each other. The composers themselves, their works, and the conductors too are involved in this presentation, but the aim is always to keep before the reader an understanding of how each type of orchestra belonged to and was justified by its own time. Mr. Bekker's scholarship and his original and provocative ideas make this analysis an extremely valuable contribution to musical literature.</p></p><p></p><h2>Titus Andronicus: Arden Shakespeare (Arden Shakespeare.

Clarity and precision, empathy, and calls-to- action happen when the writing stimulates a clear response. Capacities in writers take practice and focus and refined skill in a teacher. Fire the Imagination &#x2014; Write On! is a vehicle for developing those teaching skills that, in turn, develop writing skills in the young and old. The rigor of the lessons makes for engagement and plain old fun in working hard on good writing.

This seventh entry in the hugely popular How to Read series is a one-stop guide to understanding the world&#x2019;s great artworks. The book explains the aesthetics of schools of painting from the Renaissance masters and Impressionists to the Cubists and Modernists. It enables readers to develop swiftly an understanding of the vocabulary of painting and to discover how to look at diverse paintings in detail.In the first part of the book, the author reveals how to read paintings by considering five key areas: shape and support, style and medium, compositional devices, genre, and the meaning of recurring motifs and symbols. The second part explores fifty paintings through extracted details, accompanied by insightful commentary, training the reader and viewer to understand context and discover meaning within art. How to Read Art is the perfect companion for anyone interested in paintings and a book that no art lover&#x2019;s home should be without.</p><p><b>Liz Rideal</b>&nbsp;is an artist and writer.

But scams are also a central part of Nigeria's domestic cultural landscape. Corruption is so widespread in Nigeria that its citizens call it simply "the Nigerian factor." Willing or unwilling participants in corruption at every turn, Nigerians are deeply ambivalent about it--resigning themselves to it, justifying it, or complaining about it. They are painfully aware of the damage corruption does to their country and see themselves as their own worst enemies, but they have been unable to stop it. <i>A Culture of Corruption</i> is a profound and sympathetic attempt to understand the dilemmas average Nigerians face every day as they try to get ahead--or just survive--in a society riddled with corruption.</p><br><p> Drawing on firsthand experience, Daniel Jordan Smith paints a vivid portrait of Nigerian corruption--of nationwide fuel shortages in Africa's oil-producing giant, Internet cafï¿½s where the young launch their e-mail scams, checkpoints where drivers must bribe police, bogus organizations that siphon development aid, and houses painted with the fraud-preventive words "not for sale." This is a country where "419"--the number of an antifraud statute--has become an inescapable part of the culture, and so universal as a metaphor for deception that even a betrayed lover can say, "He played me 419." It is impossible to comprehend Nigeria today--from vigilantism and resurgent ethnic nationalism to rising Pentecostalism and accusations of witchcraft and cannibalism--without understanding the role played by corruption and popular reactions to it.</p></p><p><p>"By all measurements Nigeria, richly endowed with natural and human resources and the United States' fifth largest source of imported oil, should be one of the most prosperous of the world's developing countries. Instead it is one of the poorest. No one has done a better job than Daniel Jordan Smith of showing how and why the cancer of corruption has hobbled the giant of Africa. A Culture of Corruption is an absorbing cultural study by an anthropologist who deeply cares about the society into which he has married."<b>--Walter Carrington, former U.S. Ambassador to Nigeria</b></p><p>"This is a path-breaking study of a challenging topic for African studies, anthropology, development economics, and social sciences in general. If any country in Africa should be able to join the world's newly industrialized countries, it should be Nigeria in view of its size and its oil wealth. The common explanation of its constant failure to do so is corruption. The great merit of this book is to show that corruption has many faces in everyday life. The term is all too often used as a blanket notion. Smith shows how misleading this is by studying it as a daily reality with manifold expressions. The book fills an urgent need. We must better understand the reasons why Africa's giant is stagnating if we want to be able to say something about the continent's present-day crisis."<b>--Peter Geschiere, University of Amsterdam</b></p><p>"Nigeria is known globally as a center for scams of a variety and audacity that are astounding to those who trust that their own societies and economies run according to 'the rules.' In <i>A Culture of Corruption</i>, Daniel Jordan Smith draws on many years of living in Nigeria as an NGO representative and anthropologist to cast a very wide net around Nigerian corruption, to include contemporary official and unofficial malfeasance of all kinds. His exposition is graphic, detailed, and broadly supported. He doesn't flinch before quite terrifying case material. There is no other work that covers the same ground so clearly and in such a nuanced and observant manner."<b>--Jane I. Guyer, Johns Hopkins University</b></p><b>Daniel Jordan Smith</b> is associate professor of anthropology at Brown University. He has worked in Nigeria since the late 1980s, first as a public health adviser with a nongovernmental organization and later as an anthropologist.</p><h2>Tintinalli&#39;s Emergency Medicine: A Comprehensive Study Guide, 8th edition</h2><p><p><b>Publisher's Note: Products purchased from Third Party sellers are not guaranteed by the publisher for quality,&nbsp;authenticity, or access to any online entitlements included with the product.</b></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>The most widely used and highly regarded textbook and reference of emergency medicine -- Endorsed by the American College of Emergency Physicians</strong></p><p><b><i>A Doody's Core Title for 2019!</i></b></p><p></p><p></p><p>The 8th edition of <em>Tintinalli&#x2019;s Emergency Medicine</em> provides the depth and breadth of coverage that reflects the complexity and expertise needed to practice emergency medicine successfully in today&#x2019;s fast&#x2013;paced environments.

Based on primary and archival sources, the book is filled with interesting perspectives on what people have understood, experienced, and feared about the climate and its changes in the past. Chapters explore climate and culture in Enlightenment thought; climate debates in early America; the development of international networks of observation; the scientific transformation of climate discourse; and early contributions to understanding terrestrial temperature changes, infrared radiation, and the carbon dioxide theory of climate. But perhaps most important, this book shows what a study of the past has to offer the interdisciplinary investigation of current environmental problems.<br></p><p>James Rodger Fleming is at Colby College."The debate over global warming is far from new; in fact, science historian James Fleming has just published a scholarly treatise on the historical debate over global warming entitled Historical Perspectives on Climate Change. I would highly recommend this interesting book for an accurate<br>account of who did what first and who proposed which hypotheses. These things have been muddled in recent literature because very few researchers have taken the time to go back to the original resources."--Warren Washington in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society<br><br>"I have read the book with great interest. It is a clear and scholarly exposition of a topic which is not well understood. The book places the current debates over global warming and other fears about climate change in their historical context." --Marc Rothenberg, Smithsonian<br>Institution<br><br>"Fleming has studied the history of science and of weather, and in his book, 'Historical Perspectives on Climate Change,' published in September by Oxford University Press, he discusses the human understanding and response to the Earth's changing climate. 'Our understanding of climate<br>dynamically changes as fast or faster than the climate itself,' he said. The book looks at weather in America beginning in 1720 and ending in 1988, the start of what he calls the 'new era of global warming,' and discusses humans' reaction to the climate around them. During the colonial period, for<br>instance, the Europeans who came to America viewed this as a cold continent. They believed that cutting trees and clearing swamps would warm it up. Nineteenth-century climatologists claimed this view of the Earth's climate was wrong, and the discovery that there had been Ice Ages in the planet's<br>past fueled a move toward a global view of temperature and climate."--Ellsworth American<br><br>"While other recent books on climate change have focused on current theory and potential impact, Fleming has studied and written on the history of the concepts--how we got here and what we might learn from the past. This well-documented book starts with reflections of learned men on climate<br>and culture during the age of enlightenment and speculations on climate impact of American colonization. The following chapters are on important scientists: Fourier, Tyndall, Arrhenius, Chamberlin, and (a maverick) Huntington, who provided a foundation for studies of climate change and effects of<br>carbon dioxide. The last two chapters bring the reader up to the middle of the twentieth century as global temperature trends (most up, some down) sought explanation and carbon dioxide became implicated. A wide variety of atmospheric scientists and those curious about global climate change will find<br>this of interest."--Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society<br><br>"A lucid, well-written, and skillfully presented work; the bibliography is bountiful and sources of information are well-documented. . . . General readers; faculty."--Choice<br><br>"A series of interrelated essays on elite and popular understanding of climate and climate change offers historical perspectives dating from the period of Enlightenment to the late 20th century."--Environmental Science and Technology<br><br>"This little book is delightful for several reasons, particularly for those who wish to understand the current debate about climate change and global warming--and who doesn't? Also, it evokes the ghosts of so many characters of the past whose names are only vaguely familiar but who influenced<br>the thinking of their times, such as Ferrel, Maury, Montesquieu, Langley, Humbolt, and Arbuthnot. Finally, it is well written and clear and represents an extremely well-researched study by a competent historian"--William W. Kellogg in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society<br><br>"In a series of imaginative interrelated essays, [James Rodger Fleming] describes and examines historical perspectives on climate and climate change from the Enlightenment to the late twentieth century. Fleming's aim is not merely to record authoritative positions about climate and climate<br>change, but also to trace their origins and development, in order to shed light on contemporary perspectives on climate. . . . Fleming's history of the genealogy of ideas about climate change shows decisively that intellectual shifts are not . . . necessarily as clear-cut, revolutionary or<br>straightforward as many believe--are not the sole result of internal cognitive developments.

Such is the magical Coyote, that mythic Native American figure whose various roles are recounted here in a wonderful selection of poetry and stories.<br><br>Anthropological linguist William Bright brings together diverse portraits of Coyote from American Indian texts and modern American writing. Because Native American myths have been recited and transmitted orally, Bright addresses the special problem of converting them into written stories. His familiarity with the native languages gives his retranslations a liveliness that conveys their original vitality.<br><br>The collection also includes poetic translations and original works by important contemporary writers Leslie Silko, Gary Snyder, Wendy Rose, Peter Blue Cloud, and Simon Ortiz, along with the voice of an earlier American author&#x2015;Mark Twain.<br><br>We see how the figure of Coyote serves both to entertain and to instruct and, by his similarities to the actual biological coyote, provides a link between culture and nature. At the same time, since he embodies distinctive characteristics of <i>Homo sapiens</i>, Coyote also reflects many aspects of <i>human</i> nature.<br><br>Bright places each tale in relation to the larger Native American context and shows Coyote's affinities with classic mythological figures and popular cultural images such as Bugs Bunny. Filled with humor and at times disturbing, Coyote's tales mirror the human condition across time and cultures.</p><p>Coyote, the great North American trickster figure, is the star of linguist William Bright's fine collection of traditional Native American stories and modern poems and meditations. Bright has been studying Coyote's role in California Indian societies for four decades. Their stories tell of Coyote as a perennial loser and a figure who plays by no rules: he impregnates his own daughter, steals from his friends, and causes the world endless trouble. Bright links the biological to the cultural Coyote, and he introduces some fascinating ecological arcana, such as the fact that "Old Man Coyote"--as he's often called in traditional stories--hasn't changed much over the last 4 million years. Evolving alongside the saber-toothed tiger and the giant cave bear, Coyote somehow resisted specialization; <i>Canis latrans</i> eats almost anything and lives almost anywhere from southern Mexico to the Canadian sub-Arctic. No generation understands Coyote fully, the anthropologist Paul Radin once remarked, but no generation can live without him. Bright's affection for Coyote has yielded a necessary book about a necessary creature.<b>William Bright</b>, Emeritus Professor of Linguistics and Anthropology at the University of California, Los Angeles, is now Professor Adjoint in Linguistics at the University of Colorado.

Additionally, it introduces a broad range of topics left out of most other introductory texts but used frequently in biomedical publications, including survival curves. multiple comparisons, sensitivity and specificity of lab tests, Bayesian thinking, lod scores, and logistic, proportional hazards and nonlinear regression.<br> By emphasizing interpretation rather than calculation, this text provides a clear and virtually painless introduction to statistical principles for those students who will need to use statistics constantly in their work.

Many -statistical tests are based upon the assumption that the data are sampled from a Gaussian distribution. These tests are referred to as parametric tests. Commonly used parametric tests are listed in the first column of the table and include the t test and analysis of variance. </p><p>Tests that do not make assumptions about the population distribution are referred to as nonparametric- tests. You've already learned a bit about nonparametric tests in previous chapters. All commonly used nonparametric tests rank the outcome variable from low to high and then analyze the ranks. These tests are listed in the second column of the table and include the Wilcoxon, Mann-Whitney test, and Kruskal-Wallis tests. These tests are also called distribution-free tests. </p><p>THE EASY CASES </p><p>Choosing between parametric and nonparametric tests is sometimes easy. You should definitely choose a parametric test if you are sure that your data are sampled from a population that follows a Gaussian distribution (at least approximately). You should definitely select a nonparametric test in three situations: </p><p>1. The outcome is a rank or a score and the population is clearly not Gaussian. Examples include class ranking of students, the Apgar score for the health of newborn babies (measured on a scale of 0 to IO and where all scores are integers), the visual analogue score for pain (measured on a continuous scale where 0 is no pain and 10 is unbearable pain), and the star scale commonly used by movie and restaurant critics (* is OK, ***** is fantastic). </p><p>2. Some values are "off the scale," that is, too high or too low to measure. Even if the population is Gaussian, it is impossible to analyze such data with a parametric test since you don't know all of the values. Using a nonparametric test wi! th these data is simple. Assign values too low to measure an arbitrary very low value and assign values too high to measure an arbitrary very high value. Then perform a nonparametric test. Since the nonparametric test only knows about the relative ranks of the values, it won't matter that you didn't know all the values exactly. </p><p>3. The data are measurements and you are sure that the population is not distributed in a Gaussian manner. If the data are not sampled from a Gaussian distribution, consider whether you can transformed the values to make the distribution become Gaussian. For example, you might take the logarithm or reciprocal of all values. There are often biological or chemical reasons (as well as statistical ones) for performing a particular transform. </p><p>THE HARD CASES </p><p>It is not always easy to decide whether a sample comes from a Gaussian population. Consider these points: </p><p>If you collect many data points (over a hundred or so), you can look at the distribution of data and it will be fairly obvious whether the distribution is approximately bell shaped. A formal statistical test (Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test, not explained in this book) can be used to test whether the distribution of the data differs significantly from a Gaussian distribution. With few data points, it is difficult to tell whether the data are Gaussian by inspection, and the formal test has little power to discriminate between Gaussian and non-Gaussian distributions. </p><p>You should look at previous data as well. Remember, what matters is the distribution of the overall population, not the distribution of your sample. In deciding whether a population is Gaussian, look at all available data, not just data in the current experiment. </p><p>Consider the source of scatter. When the scatter comes from the sum of numerous sources (with no one source contributing most of the scatter), you expect to find a roughly Gaussian distribution. </p><p>When in doubt, some people choose a parametric test (because they aren't sure the Gaussian assumption is ! violated), and others choose a nonparametric test (because they aren't sure the Gaussian assumption is met). </p><p>DOES IT MATTER? </p><p>Does it matter whether you choose a parametric or nonparametric test? The answer depends on sample size. There are four cases to think about: </p><p>1. Large sample. What happens when you use a parametric test with data from a nongaussian population? The central limit theorem (discussed in Chapter 5) ensures that parametric tests work well with large samples even if the population is non-Gaussian. In other words, parametric tests are robust to deviations from Gaussian distributions, so long as the samples are large. The snag is that it is impossible to say how large is large enough, as it depends on the nature of the particular non-Gaussian distribution. Unless the population distribution is really weird, you are probably safe choosing a parametric test when there are at least two dozen data points in each group. </p><p>2. Large sample. What happens when you use a nonparametric test with data from a Gaussian population? Nonparametric tests work well with large samples from Gaussian populations. The P values tend to be a bit too large, but the discrepancy is small. In other words, nonparametric tests are only slightly less powerful than parametric tests with large samples. </p><p>3. Small samples. What happens when you use a parametric test with data from nongaussian populations? You can't rely on the central limit theorem, so the P value may be inaccurate. </p><p>4. Small samples. When you use a nonparametric test with data from a Gaussian population, the P values tend to be too high. The nonparametric tests lack statistical power with small samples. </p><p>Thus, large data sets present no problems. It is usually easy to tell if the data come from a Gaussian population, but it doesn't really matter because the nonparametric tests are so powerful and the parametric tests are so robust. Small data sets present a dilemma. It is difficult to tell if the data come from a Gaussian population, but it matt! ers a lot. The nonparametric tests are not powerful and the parametric tests are not robust.</p></p><h2>Offering Flowers, Feeding Skulls: Popular Goddess Worship in West Bengal</h2><p>The Indian state of West Bengal is home to one of the world's most vibrant traditions of goddess worship. The year's biggest holidays are devoted to the goddesses Durga and Kali, with lavish rituals, decorated statues, fireworks, and parades. In <em> Offering Flowers, Feeding Skulls</em>, June McDaniel provides a broad, accessibly written overview of Bengali goddess worship. McDaniel identifies three major forms of goddess worship, and examines each through its myths, folklore, songs, rituals, sacred texts, and practitioners. In the folk/tribal strand, which is found in rural areas, local tribal goddesses are worshipped alongside Hindu goddesses, with an emphasis on possession, healing, and animism. The tantric/yogic strand focuses on ritual, meditation, and visualization as ways of experiencing the power of the goddess directly. The devotional or bhakti strand, which is the most popular form, involves the intense love and worship of a particular form of the goddess. McDaniel traces these strands through Bengali culture and explores how they are interwoven with each other as well as with other forms of Hinduism. She also discusses how these practices have been reinterpreted in the West, where goddess worship has gained the values of sexual freedom and psychological healing, but lost its emphases on devotion and asceticism. <em>Offering Flowers, Feeding Skulls</em> takes the reader inside the lives of practicing Shaktas, including holy women, hymn singers, philosophers, visionaries, gurus, ascetics, healers, musicians, and businessmen, and offers vivid descriptions of their rituals, practices, and daily lives. Drawing on years of fieldwork and extensive research, McDaniel paints a rich, expansive portrait of this fascinating religious tradition.<br></p><p><br><strong>June McDaniel</strong> is Professor of Religious Studies and Director of the Religious Studies Program at the College of Charleston.

Why didn't the fire consume the Burning Bush? What was the Manna in the Wilderness? <em>The Miracles of Exodus</em> explores the truth about these and all the other Exodus mysteries, including the precise locations of Mount Sinai, the Red Sea Crossing, and the route of the Exodus of the Israelites from Egypt 3,000 years ago. This investigative tour de force explains the Ten Plagues, the true location of Mt. Sinai, the ultimate crossing of the Jordan, and much more. Colin Humphreys, a distinguished British scientist, uses physics, astronomy, biology, and other scientific resources to show that the mysteries and miracles of the Exodus have scientific explanations. These explanations allow us to pinpoint the exact nature, time, and place of these miracles, and to reconstruct, for the first time, the true route of the Exodus.</p><p>Presented in a "you are there" style, this book reveals what really happened and how the biblical account is remarkably accurate and historical when scientifically investigated. Profusely illustrated with maps, photographs, and explanatory tables, this book by one of the world's great scientists unlocks the mysteries of the ultimate Bible story in a fascinating and convincing way.</p></p><p><p>Colin Humpreys is a renowned Cambridge University physicist who has received considerable publicity for his ideas and research, which span many fields from computer chips to microprinting, eternal lightbulbs, and computer chips in the brain.

He has been awarded an Honorary D.Sc. by the University of Leicester. He has been president of the Physics section of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. He has published over 400 scientific papers and given plenary lectures at major international conferences throughout the world.</p>Reconstructions of biblical events by modern investigators are nothing new, but Humphreys's analysis of the Exodus reflects an unusual combination of homework, legwork and creativity. Humphreys, a materials scientist at Cambridge University, is a self-confessed amateur in the fields of archeology and biblical studies. But he emerges as the best sort of amateur, whose enthusiasm for his subject and joy in puzzle solving have a contagious appeal in spite of occasional quirkiness. As an outsider asking pesky but often astute questions, Humphreys will remind some readers of a certain physicist portrayed in Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!; and like Feynman, Humphreys shows an ability to sidestep scholarly assumptions by checking facts. Humphreys runs numbers, consults disused geological charts and old explorers' memoirs, and investigates sites on foot, unearthing fragmentary but wide-ranging evidence. The book's title is somewhat misleading since Humphreys's goal is to reconstruct the whole Exodus narrative and in particular, to retrace the likeliest route of travel and identify the correct location of Mount Sinai rather than to focus on the miracles themselves. Still, Humphreys rises to a self-imposed challenge to account for the Exodus miracles in terms of natural events (some more feasible than others) that become miraculous in light of their timing and significance for the escaping Hebrews. Although many of his hypotheses have been published before, Humphreys' refinements of detail and especially his comprehensive retracing of the Exodus route will invite curiosity, debate and perhaps some new ways of approaching the Exodus story in historical terms.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Introduction to Differential Equations With Boundary Value Problems</h2><p>100% Satisfaction is Guaranteed!

But when they set off, they can hardly predict the troubles that lie ahead with tow-ropes, unreliable weather-forecasts and tins of pineapple chunks - not to mention the devastation left in the wake of J.&#39;s small fox-terrier Montmorency. &#34;Three Men in a Boat&#34; was an instant success when it appeared in 1889, and, with its benign escapism, authorial discursions and wonderful evocation of the late-Victorian &#39;clerking classes&#39;, it hilariously captured the spirit of its age.</p><p>7 1-hour cassettesJerome K Jerome was born in Walsall in Staffordshire, England in 1859. He was the youngest of the four children of Jerome Clapp Jerome, who was a preacher and architect. His first work was On the Stage and Off, published in 1885. This novel, and the play Barbara, are inspired by his experiences in the theatre. This was followed by several plays, books and magazine articles. He is best known for his comic rendition of a boating holiday taken by three friends, Three Men in a Boat. The story is loosely based on his own various experiences of boating on the Thames. The three men are a fictionalised representations of Jerome himself, and two of his friends, George Wingrave and Carl Hentschel.

The text presented here is that of the 1932 Modern Library edition for which Bennett A. Cerf chose the "most famous and representative" of the stories from the multivolume translation of Richard F. Burton.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; The origins of The Arabian Nights are obscure. About a thousand years ago a vast number of stories in Arabic from various countries began to be brought together; only much later was the collection called The Arabian Nights or the Thousand and One Nights. All the stories are told by Shahrazad (Scheherazade), who entertains her husband, King Shahryar, whose custom it was to execute his wives after a single night. Shahrazad begins a story each night but withholds the ending until the following night, thus postponing her execution.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; This selection includes many of the stories that are universally known though seldom read in this authentic form: <br>"Alaeddin; or, the Wonderful Lamp," "Sindbad the Seaman and Sindbad the Landsman," and "Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves." These, and the tales that accompany them, make delightful reading, demonstrating, as the Modern Library noted in 1932, that Shahrazad's spell remains unbroken.</p><p>"A book that captivates in childhood and delights in age."<br> --Robert Louis Stevenson<b>The Modern Library</b> has played a significant role in American cultural life for the better part of a century.

Yet <i>Pale Fire</i> is more outrageously hilarious, and its narrative convolutions make the earlier book seem as straightforward as a fairy tale. Here's the plot--listen carefully! John Shade is a homebody poet in New Wye, U.S.A. He writes a 999-line poem about his life, and what may lie beyond death. This novel (and seldom has the word seemed so woefully inadequate) consists of both that poem and an extensive commentary on it by the poet's crazy neighbor, Charles Kinbote.<p> According to this deranged annotator, he had urged Shade to write about his own homeland--the northern kingdom of Zembla. It soon becomes clear that this fabulous locale may well be a figment of Kinbote's colorfully cracked, prismatic imagination. Meanwhile, he manages to twist the poem into an account of Zembla's King Charles--whom he believes himself to <i>be</i>--and the monarch's eventual assassination by the revolutionary Jakob Gradus.</p><p> In the course of this dizzying narrative, shots are indeed fired. But it's Shade who takes the hit, enabling Kinbote to steal the dead poet's manuscript and set about annotating it. Is that perfectly clear? By now it should be obvious that <i>Pale Fire</i> is not only a whodunit but a who-wrote-it. There isn't, of course, a single solution. But Nabokov's best biographer, Brian Boyd, has come up with an ingenious suggestion: he argues that Shade is actually guiding Kinbote's mad hand from beyond the grave, nudging him into completing what he'd intended to be a 1,000-line poem. Read this magical, melancholic mystery and see if you agree. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>In Pale Fire Nabokov offers a cornucopia of deceptive pleasures: a 999-line poem by the reclusive genius John Shade; an adoring foreword and commentary by Shade&#39;s self-styled Boswell, Dr. Charles Kinbote; a darkly comic novel of suspense, literary idolatry and one-upmanship, and political intrigue.</p><h2>Coaxing the Spirits to Dance: Art And Society in the Papuan Gulf of New Guinea</h2><p>Coaxing the Spirits to Dance explores the relationship between social life and artistic expression since the nineteenth century in one of the most important art-producing regions of Papua New Guinea.

He describes the banjo and the belly dance, Menotti opera and Gershwin tunes, histrionic conductors and the inception of the phonograph, all with vast knowledge and likable wit. Slonimsky&#39;s writing is both informed and accessible, making his wisdom a professional gem, a novice&#39;s bible and good fun for anyone who likes to read.This book sparkles with Slonimskian fact and fun. While students and scholars should hang on to their graver Harvard and Oxford dictionaries, all music lovers can be enlightened and amused by this "reading" lectionary. Set out from A to Z, the entries range from music terms, styles, and major concepts to opera synopses and musical trivia; fully a third are names of compositions. The musical polymath Slonimsky, who has also given us a lexicon of musical invective, treats all entries with an inimitable authority mixed with wit and telling anecdote. An occassional prejudice surfaces, as in the entry for animal voices: the "gibbon . . . has the loudest voice among primates, not excluding coloratura sopranos."

Butler stresses the instability of religion in Europe where state churches battled dissenters, magic, and astonishingly low church participation. He charts the transfer of these difficulties to America, including the failure of Puritan religious models, and describes the surprising advance of religious commitment there between 1700 and 1865. Through the assertion of authority and coercion, a remarkable sacralization of the prerevolutionary countryside, advancing religious pluralism, the folklorization of magic, and an eclectic, syncretistic emphasis on supernatural interventionism, including miracles, America emerged after 1800 as an extraordinary spiritual hothouse that far eclipsed the Puritan achievement&#x2015;even as secularism triumphed in Europe.</p><p><i>Awash in a Sea of Faith</i> ranges from popular piety to magic, from anxious revolutionary war chaplains to the cool rationalism of James Madison, from divining rods and seer stones to Anglican and Unitarian elites, and from Virginia Anglican occultists and Presbyterians raised from the dead to Jonathan Edwards, Joseph Smith, and Abraham Lincoln. Butler deftly comes to terms with conventional themes such as Puritanism, witchcraft, religion and revolution, revivalism, millenarianism, and Mormonism. His elucidation of Christianity&#x2019;s powerful role in shaping slavery and of a subsequent African spiritual &#x201c;holocaust,&#x201d; with its ironic result in African Christianization, is an especially fresh and incisive account.</p><p><i>Awash in a Sea of Faith</i> reveals the proliferation of American religious expression&#x2015;not its decline&#x2015;and stresses the creative tensions between pulpit and pew across three hundred years of social maturation. Striking in its breadth and deeply rooted in primary sources, this seminal book recasts the landscape of American religious and cultural history.</p></p><p>Jon Butler is William Robertson Coe Professor of American Studies and History, and Professor of Religious Studies, at Yale University.&#x201c;Anyone who wants to know about religion in America up to the Civil War would do well to read Jon Butler&#x2019;s rich, comprehensive and&#x2015;it must be said&#x2015;contentious account.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>David Martin</b><b>, </b><b><i>Times Literary Supplement</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Throughout, the richness of detail, nuance, and illustration is superb and often eye-opening...

Among the Native American peoples there, the women's economic role of food gathering was traditionally considered so important that their status was equal to that of men. A woman's most important role, that of teacher and tradition bearer, was attained as a result of life experience for which she was honored as an elder.<br>While young women gathered and prepared food, bore children, and managed the family's resources, they also developed their individual artistic skills.

What accounts for the success of free trade against then prevailing mercantilist doctrines? And how well has free trade withstood various theoretical attacks that have challenged it since Adam Smith's time? In this readable intellectual history, Douglas Irwin explains how the idea of free trade has endured against the tide of the abundant criticisms that have been leveled against it from the ancient world and Adam Smith's day to the present. An accessible, nontechnical look at one of the most important concepts in the field of economics, <i>Against the Tide</i> will allow the reader to put the ever new guises of protectionist thinking into the context of the past and discover why the idea of free trade has so successfully prevailed over time.</p><br><p> Irwin traces the origins of the free trade doctrine from premercantilist times up to Adam Smith and the classical economists. In lucid and careful terms he shows how Smith's compelling arguments in favor of free trade overthrew mercantilist views that domestic industries should be protected from import competition. Once a presumption about the economic benefits of free trade was established, various objections to free trade arose in the form of major arguments for protectionism, such as those relating to the terms of trade, infant industries, increasing returns, wage distortions, income distribution, unemployment, and strategic trade policy. Discussing the contentious historical controversies surrounding each of these arguments, Irwin reveals the serious analytical and practical weaknesses of each, and in the process shows why free trade remains among the most durable and robust propositions that economics has to offer for the conduct of economic policy.</p></p><p>The topic of "free trade" is more dense and complex than is usually presented in political debate or in the slogans or bumper stickers that these days often suffice for political discourse. Douglas A. Irwin, a professor of business at the University of Chicago, helps add depth to the discussion with this sweeping study of the business of trade between nations. He begins with Adam Smith's <i>Wealth of Nations</i> and carries through to some of history's greatest thinkers on the topic of free trade. He shows "how free trade came to occupy ... a commanding position in economics and how free trade has maintained its intellectual strength ... over the past two centuries." It is a timely and needed book.<p>"This is a useful and valuable book that brings together a wide range of historical arguments for and against free trade. It may keep many an analyst of trade policy from the need to reinvent the wheel."<b>--Jerry Z.

Most faculty are not aware that there is an extensive body of research on the topic from which instructors can learn to facilitate exceptional classroom discussion. <i>Discussion in the College Classroom</i> is a practical guide which utilizes that research, frames it sociologically, and offers advice, along with a wide variety of strategies, to help you spark a relevant conversation and steer it toward specific learning goals.</p> <p>Applicable across a spectrum of academic disciplines both online and on campus, these ideas will help you overcome the practical challenges and norms that can undermine discussion, and foster a new atmosphere of collaborative learning and critical thinking. Higher education faculty are increasingly expected to be more intentional and reflective in their pedagogical practice, and this guide shows you how to meet those expectations, improve student outcomes, and tackle the perennial problem of lagging engagement.</p> <p>Thoroughly grounded in the scholarship of teaching and learning, this book gives you concrete guidance on integrating discussion into your courses. You'll learn to:</p> <ul> <li>Overcome the challenges that inhibit effective discussion</li> <li>Develop classroom norms that facilitate discussion</li> <li>Keep discussion focused, relevant, and productive</li> <li>Maximize the utility of online student discussions</li> </ul> <p>The kind of discussion that improves learning rarely arises spontaneously. Like any pedagogical technique, careful planning and smart strategy are the keys to keeping students focused, engaged, and invested in the conversation. <i>Discussion in the College Classroom</i> helps you keep the discussion applicable to the material at hand while serving learning goals.</p></p><p><p>PRAISE FOR <br><b><i>DISCUSSION IN THE COLLEGE CLASSROOM</i></b> </p><p>"It is time for us to move beyond experientially-derived how-to-teach books. They were fine when what we had was mostly the wisdom of practice. Our pedagogical knowledge now rests on a firmer foundation. We do learn from experience, but we can learn more from systematic inquiry and analysis, especially when it come from someone who's done the research, been in the classroom, and writes with the caring commitment of a trusted colleague. Welcome to Jay Howard's <i>Discussion in the College Classroom.</i>"<br> <b>&#x2015;From the foreword by Maryellen Weimer,</b> teaching and learning scholar, author, and editor of <i>The Teaching Professor</i> newsletter </p><p>"This is an innovative and very effective book. It should be in every faculty member's library. At its core, it applies key ideas on behavioral norms to develop ore effective ways to engage students in deeper learning through more effective discussions. It allowed me, and will allow others, to see important ways to improve our discussions and, importantly, to see ways to develop new applications of the fundamental principles presented. It is also a very well-designed set of lessons for helping faculty learn to use these ideas.... The ideas throughout are based on some of the best research on college-level teaching and learning."<br> <b>&#x2015;Craig E. Nelson,</b> professor emeritus, Indiana University, and president emeritus of the International Society for the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning </p><p>"Howard does college faculty an enormous service through this expert and comprehensive analysis of effective classroom discussion.

Pike,</b> professor of sociology, Augsburg College</p><p>When a classroom discussion goes well, it can feel almost magical--students are engaged and willing to speak up, and they are experiencing the kind of learning that will last them a lifetime. Excellent discussion need not be rare. <i>Discussion in the College Classroom</i> is a guide to creating that meaningful learning experience every time. </p><p>There's no better method than classroom discussion to actively engage students with course material.

In the Bible there are angels to be read&nbsp;&nbsp;about from Genesis to Revelation, and you'll find&nbsp;&nbsp;many of them in the pages. You'll even meet angels&nbsp;&nbsp;who visit us today a learn a bit about the&nbsp;&nbsp;messages they have to convey. In this book you are&nbsp;&nbsp;invited to ponder the tales of ministering spirits who&nbsp;&nbsp;by their presence provide not just succor, but the&nbsp;&nbsp;reassuring evidence of a loving God who is forever&nbsp;&nbsp;watching over us. And when you finish it's likely&nbsp;&nbsp;you will have a new appreciation of phenomenon&nbsp;&nbsp;that heretofore you may have only sensed. This&nbsp;&nbsp;inspirational book of angels will cause you to look back&nbsp;&nbsp;over your life and recall certain inexplicable&nbsp;&nbsp;happenings that left you puzzled or in awe. It is&nbsp;&nbsp;then that you will understand some of the mystery and&nbsp;&nbsp;beauty of the events related in these stories.&nbsp;&nbsp;Gradually your understanding will deepen, so that&nbsp;&nbsp;you, too, may hear what the poet Betty Banner has&nbsp;&nbsp;heard as "the swish of passing wings."&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Angels In Our Midst</i> was created by&nbsp;&nbsp;the editors of <i>Guideposts&nbsp;&nbsp;Magazine</i>, a monthly magazine filled with true stories of&nbsp;&nbsp;people's adventures in faith.

The tensor algebra in EN and RN is developed in Chapters I and II. Chapter II introduces a sub-group of the affine group, then deals with the identification of quantities in EN. The tensor analysis in XN is developed in Chapter IV. In chapters VI through IX, Professor Schouten presents applications of the theory that are both intrinsically interesting and good examples of the use and advantages of the calculus. Chapter VI, intimately connected with Chapter III, shows that the dimensions of physical quantities depend upon the choice of the underlying group, and that tensor calculus is the best instrument for dealing with the properties of anisotropic media. In Chapter VII, modern tensor calculus is applied to some old and some modern problems of elasticity and piezo-electricity. Chapter VIII presents examples concerning anholonomic systems and the homogeneous treatment of the equations of Lagrange and Hamilton. Chapter IX deals first with relativistic kinematics and dynamics, then offers an exposition of modern treatment of relativistic hydrodynamics. Chapter X introduces Dirac&#x2019;s matrix calculus. Two especially valuable features of the book are the exercises at the end of each chapter, and a summary of the mathematical theory contained in the first five chapters &#x2014; ideal for readers whose primary interest is in physics rather than mathematics.</p><p></p></p><p>Dutch mathematician Jan Arnoldous Schouten (1883&#x2013;1971) was an important contributor to the development of tensor calculus&nbsp;and one of the founders of Amsterdam's Mathematisch Centrum.</p><h2>Best Practices in Midwifery: Using the Evidence to Implement Change</h2><p><p>First Edition an AJN Book of the Year Award Winner! </p> <p>This second edition of a groundbreaking book is substantially revised to deliver the foundation for an evidence-based model for best practices in midwifery, a model critical to raising the United States' current standing as the bottom-ranking country for maternity mortality among developed nations.With a focus on updated scientific evidence as the framework for midwifery practice, the book includes 21 completely new chapters that address bothcontinuing and new areas of practice, the impact of institutional and national policies, and the effects of diversity and globalization.

Carried along by prose that is as sleek and slinky as its subject."&#x2015;Christine Stansell, University of Chicago</strong></p> Alice Echols reveals the ways in which disco transformed popular music, propelling it into new sonic territory and influencing rap, techno, and trance. She probes the complex relationship between disco and the era's major movements: gay liberation, feminism, and African American rights. You won't say "disco sucks" as disco thumps back to life in this pulsating look at the culture and politics that gave rise to the music. 20 black-and-white photographs</p><p>"Echols's love of music, her acumen about popular culture, and her gifts as a leading cultural historian come together in this remarkable book. The book is fascinating, carried along by prose that is as sleek and slinky as its subject."-Christine Stansell, author of American Moderns"Hot Stuff describes the book as well as its subject: a thoughtful and sophisticated treatment of a significant but much-maligned music."-Tim Taylor, professor, Departments of Ethnomusicology and Musicology, UCLA"Echols aims for-and thoroughly achieves-a range of higher cultural insights. . . . Using encyclopedic knowledge of the eras' biggest stars, she shows how all sorts of musical disco styles played a 'central role' in broadening the contours of 'blackness, femininity, and male homosexuality' in America. . . . Revelatory."-Publishers Weekly"Without question, Alice Echols is one of America's best cultural critics working the beat between popular and academic cultures. With characteristic stylistic verve and scholarly acumen, Echols trolls the edges of our culture's underbelly to discern its central place in politics and economics. In Hot Stuff, she finds disco to be crucial for understanding what happened in 1970s America. Thus invariably, Echols provides a surprising take on familiar scenes by pointing out potholes and pitfalls of late twentieth-century American culture, exploring regions of experience previously overlooked or discounted. Her deepimmersion in the subjects of her research, thorough oral histories, and extensive archival investigation flesh out her absolutely original critical insights."-Paula Rabinowitz, author of Black &amp; White &amp; NoirAlice Echols is a professor of American studies and history at Rutgers University.

Dent, the Everyman Library has always tried to make the best books ever written available to the greatest number of people at the lowest possible price. Unique editorial features that help Everyman Paperback Classics stand out from the crowd include: a leading scholar or literary critic&#39;s introduction to the text, a biography of the author, a chronology of her or his life and times, a historical selection of criticism, and a concise plot summary. All books published since 1993 have also been completely restyled: all type has been reset, to offer a clarity and ease of reading unique among editions of the classics; a vibrant, full-color cover design now complements these great texts with beautiful contemporary works of art. But the best feature must be Everyman&#39;s uniquely low price. Each Everyman title offers these extensive materials at a price that competes with the most inexpensive editions on the market-but Everyman Paperbacks have durable binding, quality paper, and the highest editorial and scholarly standards.The first of Trollope&#39;s popular Barsetshire novels, set in the fictional cathedral town of Barchester, &#34;The Warden centers on the honorable cleric Septimus Harding, one of Trollope&#39;s most memorable characters. When Harding is accused of mismanaging church funds, his predicament lays bare the complexities of the Victorian world and of nineteenth-century provincial life. And, as Louis Auchincloss observes in his Introduction, &#34;The theme of &#34;The Warden presents the kind of social problem that always fascinated Trollope: the inevitable clash of ancient privilege with modern social awareness.&#34;</p><h2>Empires: The Logic of World Domination from Ancient Rome to the United States</h2><p>"Herfried Munkler is a walking one-man think tank."<br> <i>Die Zeit</i> <p>Until recently, it was thought by many that empires were relics of the past. But suddenly, in the wake of 9/11, the global war on terror and the invasion of Iraq, the question of imperial power has returned to the centre of debate: we now seem to be faced with a new American empire that many people regard as threatening. Do the politicians in Washington dictate the rules that the rest of the world must follow? Or do empires have a logic of their own to which even the most powerful rulers must succumb?</p> <p>In this major new book, Herfried Munkler analyses the characteristics of empires and traces the rise and fall of imperial powers from Ancient Rome to the present day. What is an empire? What risks does an imperial order face and what opportunities are offered? Munkler shows how empires provide stability and examines the dangers they face when their powers are overstretched. He argues that, while earlier empires from Ancient China and Ancient Rome to the Spanish, Portuguese and British empires had their own historical conditions, certain basic principles concerning the development and preservation of power can be discerned in all empires and are still relevant today.</p> <p>This book is a commanding walk through the history of empires and at the same time a brilliant analysis of the most modern of topics. It will appeal to students and scholars of international politics and history as well as general readers interested in political history and contemporary world politics.</p></p><p>Until recently, it was thought by many that empires were relics of the past.

Offering coverage from antiquity to the present, <em>Political Philosophy: The Essential</em> <em>Texts</em> is a historically organized collection of the most significant works from nearly 2,500 years of political philosophy. It moves from classical thought (Plato, Aristotle) through the medieval period (Aquinas) to modern perspectives (Machiavelli, Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Hume, Adam Smith, Hamilton and Madison, Kant). The book includes work from major nineteenth-century thinkers (Hegel, Marx and Engels, Mill) and twentieth-century theorists (Rawls, Nozick, Foucault, Habermas, Nussbaum) and also presents a variety of notable documents and addresses, including the Declaration of Independence, the Bill of Rights, and speeches by Abraham Lincoln and Martin Luther King, Jr. The readings are substantial or complete texts, not fragments. <br> An especially valuable feature of this volume is that the works of each author are introduced with an engaging essay by a leading contemporary authority. These introductions include Richard Kraut on Plato and Aristotle; Paul J. Weithman on Aquinas; Roger D. Masters on Machiavelli; Jean Hampton on Hobbes; A. John Simmons on Locke; Joshua Cohen on Rousseau and Rawls; Donald W. Livingston on Hume; Charles L. Griswold, Jr., on Adam Smith; Bernard E. Brown on Hamilton and Madison; Paul Guyer on Kant; Steven B. Smith on Hegel; Richard Miller on Marx and Engels; Jeremy Waldron on Mill; Thomas Christiano on Nozick; Thomas A. McCarthy on Foucault and Habermas; and Eva Feder Kittay on Nussbaum.</p><p>Steven M. Cahn is at City University of New York.<br>"An excellent collection and a manageable size. The introductory essays are insightful and will help students gain access to the texts."--Michael J.

On one campus after another, there are stirrings that seem to presage a willingness to think afresh about the criteria that determine tenure and measure the success of faculty careers. Scholarship Reconsidered speaks directly to these issues and should enrich a growing debate that may have important consequences for higher education."<br> &#x2014;Derek Bok, Harvard University <p>"Scholarship Reconsidered is a thoughtful and welcome addition to a growing conversation about teaching and research in the nation?s universities.

It&#x2019;s one parent&#x2019;s view, the process seen from beginning to end through the prism of a father&#x2019;s own flesh and blood. (Watch your step&#x2014;there are lots of metaphors running loose around here.) Like many big subjects, college admissions plays itself out on a small scale. The great issues it raises, the clashing interests and massive institutions it involves, come to earth in the lives of ordinary people, clustered more often than not in families. That&#x2019;s how it happened to us.<br> <br>It began with a trickle, which is why I didn&#x2019;t notice anything at first. &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s going to Elon College?&#x201d; I asked innocently enough, fingering the brochure that arrived in the mail one day. There was no answer, since no one in the house had ever heard of Elon College, much less expressed an interest in it.<br> <br>&#x201c;Occidental College?&#x201d; I called out the next day, when the mail arrived with another brochure&#x2014;or viewbook, as I learned to call them in the admissions world. &#x201c;Who in his right mind would go to an overpriced money trap like Occidental College?&#x201d;<br> <br>It was a sardonic question, as I&#x2019;ll explain in a moment, and it too was met with silence. On the third day there were two fat envelopes and another viewbook, also from schools I hadn&#x2019;t heard of, and then four the next day, and the next. Within a month, more than a hundred envelopes and viewbooks had been stuffed in the mailbox, glowing with color photos of cheerful undergraduates lounging on sunlit knolls against backdrops of shade trees and redbrick towers. The viewbooks were printed on paper so thick and voluptuous they might have been mistaken for the leaves of a rubber plant&#x2014;you didn&#x2019;t know whether to read them or slurp them like a giraffe. And each was addressed to my sixteen-going-on-seventeen-year-old son, whose name had somehow found its way onto a mailing list of high school juniors.<br> <br>My boy was being solicited, as surely and shamelessly as a sailor come to port.<br> <br>This was something new, something unexpected. I came to see over the next many months that what had once been a fairly brief and straightforward process, in which the children of the middle and upper classes found a suitable college, filled out an application, got in, and then went happily away, returning home only now and then to celebrate holidays and borrow money, has evolved into a multiyear rite of passage, often beginning before puberty.<br> <br>For some of us, anyway. It&#x2019;s worth remembering at the outset that most American high schoolers go on to college, roughly 70 percent of them, and 80 percent of those attend schools that don&#x2019;t involve the difficulties encountered in these pages. Most college kids go to what admissions people call &#x201c;nonselective&#x201d; schools, and many of them begin at two-year institutions; it&#x2019;s not too much to say that there&#x2019;s a seat in American higher education for anyone who wants one. Even the cost won&#x2019;t be prohibitive for the majority of students. More than 50 percent of us spend less than $10,000 a year on college, and a good chunk of this can usually be covered by loans and grants. For lots of high school graduates the pressing issue of higher education is finding the time off from work to take advantage of it.<br> <br>All Americans, by virtue of being Americans, are winners of life&#x2019;s lotto, in my opinion, as citizens of the most prosperous and least class-bound country in history. But the people spoken of in this book, my family included, are luckier than most. I had a happy childhood. My own children are healthy and don&#x2019;t hate me, or say they don&#x2019;t, and chief among my wife&#x2019;s numberless virtues are tolerance, patience, and good humor. We live in a reasonably safe neighborhood in one of those &#x201c;close-in&#x201d; suburbs that have suddenly become desirable. I have a job, as many Americans do not at the moment, and while we&#x2019;re far from well-to-do, the money we bring home puts us, in my layman&#x2019;s reckoning, in the bottom quintile of the lower upper middle class. As a consequence we can entertain a wide choice of futures for our children.<br> <br>I have no right to complain, in other words. My gripes and whines, my missteps and misfortunes in trying to get my son into a highly selective college are the complaints of a man whom fate has treated kindly. I hope that readers, forgiving as always, will keep this in mind as they go along. In <i>Ahead of the Curve</i>, his wonderful book about his years at Harvard Business School, Philip Delves Broughton faced the same problem. How do you chronicle personal misadventures that are themselves, in the large scheme of things, the result of unbelievable luck? Only the luckiest people get to be unlucky in this way. Imagine George Clooney bursting into tears because his lingerie-model girlfriend broke the kitchen faucet in his thirty-room chalet on Lake Como: you will be excused for thinking the lucky bastard really ought to dry up and get over it. As Broughon said about his own difficulties at Harvard, these are high-class problems. So are mine, and I&#x2019;m grateful for them.<br> <br>MY LUCK IN HIGHER EDUCATION showed itself early, for I was a college student just as a great transformation got under way. I write about this larger history later, but my own entanglement with it may be worth recounting briefly here.<br> <br>Both my father and mother were the first in their families to graduate from college, and it was always assumed that my brothers and I would go to college too. Having learned to despise the Chicago winters as only a Chicagoan can, I hoped to get as far away from Lake Michigan as I could and still remain in the contiguous United States. I studied the map.<br> <br>California!<br> <br>My parents were obliging, so long as they could afford whatever accredited school I settled on. They had already dispatched my two brothers to the adult world and were now dropping gentle hints that I might want to get my own show on the road too. With the aid of a college guide in our public library&#x2014;but without <i>U.S. News</i> rankings, the massive <i>Fiske Guide</i>, the Internet, a single tour of colleges, or direct-mail solicitations of any kind&#x2014;I applied to three schools in California, another on the East Coast, and a state school in Illinois as a &#x201c;safety.&#x201d; The only school outside California that I longed for figures prominently in the pages that follow, what I will call Big State University. I had seen it years earlier on a family trip to the East Coast. It was my first exposure to the idyll of higher ed, to the brick buildings and sun-kissed lawns where students drowsed, the blue-jeaned girls making parabolas through the plazas on their bikes, the intoxicating air of postadolescence and preadulthood. I never quite got over it. The school, for its part, was less enchanted with me than I was with it, and I recall the day that the thin envelope arrived, bearing the return address of the admissions dean, as a dark, cold day.<br> <br>I wound up at the just-mentioned Occidental, in Los Angeles. The next four years straddled the hump of the 1970s, just the moment when the revolution of a decade before was being ratified as everyday life. The insurgents had breached the battlements and settled into the captain&#x2019;s quarters. The renegades of 1968 became the tenure-track assistant profs of 1975 (and the department chairs of 1990). Core curriculums were jettisoned, parietal rules struck down, curfews abandoned. All-girl schools opened their doors to men and all-boy schools welcomed, and how, women; and schools that were already co-ed accelerated the integration of the sexes. Administrations empaneled student committees and endowed them with managerial powers that would have been unimaginable only five years before. Customs that we now take for granted&#x2014;student evaluation of teachers, kids sitting on tenure committees&#x2014;were introduced and soon became standard.<br> <br>Some people saw these reforms as a major advance for educational democracy. Others saw it as an abdication of responsibility by adults who should have known better. Of the two sides I suspected at the time that the second had it right on the merits, even as I delighted in the indulgences offered by the first.<br> <br>College life has changed in many particulars since then. The students are by all accounts more career-minded, more mild-mannered, and less politically enthused than we were. Their music is better (no K.C. and the Sunshine Band). Drug use is down, and sexual promiscuity&#x2014;to use an anachronism that was losing favor even when I was in school&#x2014;has been hedged in by formal rules governing sexual conduct and by the clinical oversight of health professionals. Still the general shape that schools assumed in the 1970s stubbornly remains, which is why the experience of a moss-back like me remains pertinent, for I took full advantage of the new system as it was then being born. Without a core curriculum, I pursued classes like &#x201c;African Literature of the 1970s,&#x201d; &#x201c;Women in Film,&#x201d; &#x201c;Our Bodies Our Selves for Men,&#x201d; and so on, interspersed with a few dying holdovers from the old regime&#x2014;survey courses in astronomy, Shakespeare, American literature, and other general-education offerings that, in many selective schools, have since gone the way of the snail darter.<br> <br>The greater part of my energies were expended in earthier pursuits. I explored the great city of Los Angeles, joined a rock-and-roll band, became a regular at a Zen temple, attended concerts without number, swooned through doomed romances, and pursued a dozen other forms of fun that had nothing to do with traditional education&#x2014;and all of which, more to the point, could have been pursued at a much lower cost if I hadn&#x2019;t pretended to be a student.<br> <br>This casual and scattershot approach to the privilege of a higher education&#x2014;an approach that was widely shared among the non-poor of my generation&#x2014;intersected with reality only when it came time to graduate. While we&#x2019;d been busy doing our part, diligently drinking beer and chasing skirts, something strange had happened to the general economy. My classmates and I emerged from school into a labor market limp from exhaustion, stupefied from the manhandling of Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, and Jimmy Carter. The <i>L.A. Times</i>, in physical size, had always been a big newspaper, plump with advertising, but by the late seventies even it had slimmed down from the lack of &#x201c;Help Wanted&#x201d; ads. Each sunny morning it landed with a little airy plop on the doorstep of our student housing, from which one of my roommates or I would retrieve it. We would carry it to the breakfast table, sweep aside the crumpled cans of Falstaff, and turn with mounting dread to the classifieds.<br> <br>This was in the spring. We were seniors about to be loosed upon the world, and none of us had the prospect of a job. As we scanned the job listings, our dread was two-pronged: first, that we might never find a way to earn a living; and second, that we might find a job. As it turned out, only the first fear was realistic. We were majors in the most liberal of the liberal arts: one in music, another in art history, a third in the visual arts (a fancy word for &#x201c;movies&#x201d;), and one in something called &#x201c;the philosophy of religion.&#x201d; And morning after morning the <i>Times</i> classifieds failed to yield up even one suitable advertisement. A minimally acceptable listing would have read:<br> <br>PHILOSOPHY SPECIALIST&#x2014;pref. w/expertise in epistemological implications of Anselm&#x2019;s ontological proofs and the lyrics of Howlin&#x2019; Wolf. Hours 1&#x2013;5 p.m. Generous sal./benefits. No refs. nec. No exp. nec. Pool privileges. Employer assumes payment of all student loans. BYO bong. Applicant does not have to wear shoes.<br> <br>Not finding this, we grew desperate&#x2014;so desperate, sometimes, that we would get all duded up in T-shirts and shorts and visit our college&#x2019;s job placement officer. As I remember her, she was a cheerful woman, which was perfectly understandable: as a career counselor at a liberal arts college in 1978, she had a steady paycheck and nothing to do. At my third or fourth appearance she roused herself long enough to subject me to a battery of &#x201c;employment tests,&#x201d; of the kind that are no longer in fashion.<br> <br>For two hours, alone in a cubicle, I typed, I spelled, I placed words in alphabetical order, I analyzed charts and graphs. When I was done she called me into her office. Nowadays, under similar circumstances, a career counselor would take a more positive, therapeutic approach. She might tell the student how &#x201c;trainable&#x201d; he was, and how marvelously &#x201c;transferable&#x201d; his skills were.<br> <br>But in the 1970s no one was in a pitying mood. &#x201c;You must understand,&#x201d; my career counselor said, glancing through the papers, &#x201c;that you have no marketable skills whatsoever.&#x201d;<br> <br>So I became a journalist.<br> <br>LUCK AGAIN. I MENTION MY own experience because it nicely encapsulates a larger confusion I have encountered in my recent efforts to wedge my son into college. While expending vast amounts of money and energy on higher education&#x2014;both selling it and buying it&#x2014;we seem not to be sure what it&#x2019;s for.<br> <br>I hate to generalize (actually, I love to generalize) but I think that Americans, as a practical people, are most excited about getting things, a job or a skill or a Wendy&#x2019;s coupon, that can in turn be used to get us other things, a cheeseburger or paycheck, which, in sufficient quantities, can get us just about anything. Whatever it is we&#x2019;re after, we want to make it pay. As a rule we don&#x2019;t get terribly excited about the ineffable. Matthew Arnold, the nineteenth-century essayist, thought up a lovely phrase in trying to describe what people should do when they go to college: learning &#x201c;to like what right reason ordains, and to follow her authority.&#x201d; Arnold also coined the phrase &#x201c;the best that has been thought and said,&#x201d; the study of which was supposed to be the substance of a liberal education.<br> <br>That was his idea anyway. Neither of these pretty phrases applies to what Americans expect from higher education, except in the smallest percentage of cases. We suffer from a built-in confusion of means and ends. We want college (the means) to produce results (the ends) that it wasn&#x2019;t built for. With its ample time for leisure, its relatively light workload, its often leafy setting, its discursive methods of instruction, its vast, comprehensive libraries, college was designed for contemplation, for the slow, steady nurturing of the spirit. It wasn&#x2019;t designed to do what most Americans want it to do: set their kids up to get a good job. If the end we seek is the acquisition of marketable skills, there are much speedier means of doing this than a four-year education in the liberal arts.<br> <br>What we&#x2019;re left with instead is an entity that isn&#x2019;t the one thing or the other, neither a preparation for productive employment nor an Arnoldian idyll, though it combines elements of both: it&#x2019;s in part an apprenticeship, in part an immersion in the finer things; part summer camp, part group therapy, part booze cruise.<br> <br>I&#x2019;M GETTING AHEAD OF MYSELF. It may be that, not really knowing why we want college for our children, we want it even more. But the sources of my anxiety were more immediate. Readers will notice, perhaps, that I sometimes appear to dwell on the issue of cost. It was much on my mind, as it is on the minds of most parents in our situation; and the cost keeps going up. Another cause for concern was the looming presence of the SuperKids. I kept reading about these SuperKids. They figured as protagonists in the innumerable articles that appeared in newspapers and magazines about the craziness of college admissions. A typical SuperKid receives a perfect 2400 on their SATs, earns a 4.3 grade-point average, stars as captain of the football team or the volleyball team, spend...</p><h2>Moses Maimonides: Physician, Scientist, and Philosopher</h2><p>A collection of papers by twenty-one of the leading Maimonides scholars throughout the world.</p><p></p><h2>Film Theory and Criticism: Introductory Readings, 5th Edition</h2><p>Since publication of the first edition in 1974, <em>Film Theory and Criticism</em>, previously edited by Gerald Mast, Marshall Cohen, and Leo Braudy, has been the most widely used and cited anthology of critical writings about film. Extensively revised and updated, this fifth edition is ideal for undergraduate and graduate courses in film theory and criticism. Featuring both classic texts and cutting-edge essays from almost a century of thought and writing about the movies, it includes 19 articles new to this edition and new introductions for the individual sections. The sections themselves have been reformulated to help lead readers into a richer understanding of what the movies have and can accomplish both as individual works and as contributions to what has been called "the art form of the twentieth century." Building upon the wide range of selections and the extensive historical coverage that marked previous editions, this collection stretches from the earliest attempts to define the cinema to the most recent efforts to place film in the context of psychology, sociology, and philosophy and to explore issues of gender and race. A newly conceived section on Film Narrative and the Other Arts has been added, the section on Film Genre has been reorganized to include a special focus on the horror film, and a new subsection of essays addresses the issue of film spectatorship. This volume also features new and more accurate translations of the important essays of Sergei Eisenstein and gives more space to such important theorists as Andrï¿½ Bazin and Christian Metz.</p><p>Marshall Cohen, Dean of Humanities, both at University of Southern California.Praise for the previous edition: "Essential reading for the serious film student."--Jerry Allen White, University of Oklahoma<br><br>"Very well put together anthology which strikes a persuasive balance between classical and contemporary texts.

Authors and readers, great and small, all shared the impression that they were caught between truth and falsehood, and moreover that the 'probable-improbable' they relished so much was being manipulated by the complex strategies of the court, the police and the petty hordes of the evil-minded. We cannot understand the curiosity of the Parisian public without realizing that they did at least know one thing: the extent they were being made fools of." </p><p>The eighteenth century was awash with rumor and talk. The words and opinions of ordinary people filled the streets of Paris. But were these simply the isolated grumblings and gossip of the crowd, or is it possible to speak of genuine "public opinion" among the common people? This is the subject of <em>Subversive Words</em>, the newest book by French historian Arlette Farge. Farge begins with Jï¿½rgen Habermas's notion of a bourgeois public sphere. However, whereas Habermas was concerned mostly with the "cultured classes," Farge focuses on the uneducated common people. </p><p>Drawing on chronicles, newspapers, memoirs, police reports, and news sheets from the time, she finds that by the second half of the eighteenth century ordinary Parisians had come to assert their right to hold and declare clear opinions on what was happening in their city&#x2014;visible, real, everyday events such as executions, price rises, and revolts. Yet the government preferred to regard ordinary Parisians as unsophisticated, impulsive, or inept. In the years leading up to the Revolution, however, the administration increasingly feared the mobilization of these people. Officially, it denied the existence of any distinct popular public opinion, but in practice it kept the streets of Paris under regular surveillance through a system of spies, inspectors, and observers. </p><p>Amid this curious tension between denial and action, Farge argues, popular rumors arose and gained a life of their own. Wise and filled with vivid descriptions of everyday life, <em>Subversive Words</em> is cultural and intellectual history at its best.</p></p><p>In this perceptive and engaging book, Arlette Farge argues that there was a popular public sphere in eighteenth-century France. The eighteenth century was awash with rumour and talk; the words and opinions of ordinary people filled the streets of Paris. <p>Drawing on chronicles, newspapers, memoirs, police reports and newsheets from the time, Farge shows that ordinary Parisians had definite opinions on what was happening in their city - visible, real, everyday events such as executions, price rises, and revolts. Yet the political significance of these opinions was denied by a government which preferred to regard them as unsophisticated, impulsive, and inept. </p> <p>Farge argues that, while public opinion continued to be officially excluded from the political field and even denied an existence by those in high places, it became one of the main sources of fear to the monarchy, which tried to keep it under continual surveillance through a system of spies, inspectors and observers. It was amid this curious tension, she argues, that popular rumours arose, and even gained a life of their own.</p> <p>This important and original book addresses a range of issues - including the nature of public opinion, the relation between rulers and ruled, and the role of popular rumours - which will be of great interest to students and researchers in the social and cultural history of early modern Europe.</p><p>Arlette Farge is Director of Research in Modern History at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique in Paris.

The title reflects the nearly three centuries of belief that some people are socially unfit by virtue of a defective biology, and echoes an earlier theory of degeneracy, dating to biblical antiquity, in which some people were deemed unfit because of some transgression against religious law. The author presents the first biological theory of degeneracy--onanism--and then follows the development of degeneracy theory throughout the nineteenth century and its application to a variety of social classes. The key intellectual theories and their proponents form the framework of this exploration, which includes the concepts of evolution and heredity and how they were applied to social problems. These ideas are followed into the twentieth century with the development of theories of positive and negative eugenics, the establishment of compulsory sterilization laws, racism and anti-Semitism, and the Holocaust. This story of misapplied science and technology is one that still haunts humanity in the twenty-first century. The ghost of eugenics recurs in many guises during debates and controversies about intelligence testing, genetic screening, prenatal diagnosis, gene therapy, new reproductive strategies, and uses of our genomic information. Carlson ends his discussion of the history of humanity in this arena with an exploration of the future of genetics that is based on new technologies and application of the Human Genome Project findings, as well as a discussion of the death of the old eugenics and of the problems that will not go away, including our ambivalence about our own biology.</p><p>I am going to say it clearly and succinctly: this brand-new book is one of the most important scholarly works of the year. Seeking to understand why some people were poor, homeless, criminally inclined, mentally ill, and in other ways socially inadequate, 19th-century theorists turned to the science of eugenics, the concept of genetically unfit people. This stunning book is an exploration of the profound contemporary resonance of this concept and how it directly contributed to such persecutions as the Holocaust.<p> Certain individuals were judged "degenerate" as early as biblical times, and the condition was viewed as a punishment for religious transgression. Noted author Elof Axel Carlson traces the idea that degeneracy was biologically determined and shows how the social application of the label changed throughout the last century as the new academic discipline of sociology emerged. Carlson describes the failures and abuses of the social movements in the United States and Europe with their sorry history of racism, anti-Semitism, and violations of basic human rights.</p><p> Carlson writes beautifully, but I want to warn readers that this is not a book to be looked at lightly. It probably couldn't have the power it does if it did not include the wealth of illustrations and extensive notes, but it is indeed a serious study of this disturbing science. As Carlson writes in his Introduction, "Readers of this book may feel uncomfortable, as I certainly did, when they realize that there is a lot of mythology associated with the origins of the eugenics movement. It is embarrassing to see many strange bedfellows in the development of the idea of unfit people, and it should give us pause if we believe that the Holocaust could have been predicted from its earliest roots." I shivered when I read that statement. <i>--Charles Decker</i></p>The Unfit: A History of a Bad Idea is a valuable contribution to historical scholarship relating to the eugenics movements of the 19th and 20th centuries. Carlson recounts some of the familiar episodes described in several other books on eugenics published in the past two decades, but he also provides a broader perspective on the topic. Carlson traces the idea of unfit races from biblical times to European and American laws dealing with poverty, crime, famine, disease, mental illness, and illegitimacy. By showing that the idea of the unfit has social, political, and religious origins and uses outside of the biomedical context, Carlson helps us to understand the broader context of the eugenics movements, as well as the challenges for social policies that attempt to respond to the needs of people who may be deemed unfit. Indeed, one of the more disturbing inferences that many readers will draw from the book is that the conceptual underpinnings of the eugenics movements did not come solely from the philosophies of the wealthy and powerful classes; rather, they were also derived from the attitudes, beliefs, and religious traditions of ordinary people. <p> Carlson shares some relevant biographical information with the reader in the introduction to his book. He had a Lutheran father and a Swedish-American mother, both of whom abandoned their religious backgrounds. He lived in slums during his childhood, had a brother with a congenital heart defect, and had half-siblings who were raised in an orphanage after his mother's first marriage failed. His mother had paranoid schizophrenia and had been institutionalized before she met his father. According to Carlson, his whole family would have been classified as unfit according to many of the standards used in the 19th and 20th centuries. If his mother had lived in a different state, such as Indiana, she would have been sterilized. If his family had lived in Germany or Poland, they might have all perished in the Nazi concentration camps. Given this background, one can see why Carlson has a special concern for the unfit. </p><p> Carlson begins his account of the unfit in ancient Israel, going back more than 3000 years. The Israelites regarded the Amalekites, a population that lived in Ashdod in southwest Palestine, as unfit. The town of Ashdod was one of five occupied by the Philistines. According to Carlson, ``the Amalekites were perceived as degenerate people with evil habits, who should not only be shunned but exterminated.'' The Israelites also believed the Amalekites had been created evil and that they had corrupted the Jewish people by marrying and breeding with Jews. Carlson invites the reader to draw an ironic parallel between Israelites' attitudes toward the Amalekites in the 12th century b.c.e. and Nazi attitudes toward the Jews in the 20th century. </p><p> From ancient Israel, Carlson leaps ahead in time to the development of the theory of degeneracy in 18th-century Europe. Many Europeans, especially the English, French, and Swiss, regarded masturbation, or onania (after the sin of Onan, discussed in Genesis, chapter 38), as a form of moral degeneracy, or ``self-pollution,'' that could lead to diseases such as stunted growth, abnormal development of sexual organs, and tuberculosis (known at the time as consumption). Although it was initially viewed as a sin, masturbation was soon classified as a disease. The theory of degeneracy soon expanded from its focus on masturbation to encompass vagrancy, crime, poverty, insanity, and mental retardation. In 1857 the physician Benedict Morel published a book that postulated several different causes of degeneracy, including alcohol, narcotics, tobacco, and tainted bread. Morel also suggested that syphilis and tuberculosis could lead to degeneracy. </p><p> Others believed that degeneracy was the result of hereditary factors. Cesare Lombroso hypothesized the existence of a separate race of human beings, Homo delinquens, who were born to be criminals. Elisha Harris, a physician who conducted a study of prisoners in New York, traced the lineage of many of them back to a woman he named ``Margaret, mother of criminals.'' Herbert Spencer, who was influenced by Thomas Malthus's Essay on the Principle of Population, opposed public charities for the poor, sick, and disabled and argued that the government should not interfere with the natural laws of survival, which tend to weed out unfit members of the human population. Spencer proposed this idea, which later became known as social Darwinism, almost a decade before Charles Darwin published On the Origin of Species. </p><p> Carlson also discusses many of the well-known chapters in the history of eugenics, including the founding of the movement as a ``scientific'' field; the establishment of the Eugenics Record Office in Cold Spring Harbor, New York; the passage of compulsory sterilization laws in the United States; the Supreme Court's infamous decision in Buck v. Bell, which affirmed the constitutionality of sterilization laws; the origins of the Ku Klux Klan; Nazi Germany's campaign to purify the fatherland by killing 6 million Jews; and the eventual dissolution of the eugenics movement. </p><p> The unique contribution of this book is that it makes the reader aware of the complexities of the eugenics movement. Carlson shows that long before Francis Galton coined the term ``eugenics,'' scientists, physicians, philosophers, social reformers, and theologians had discussed the idea of an unfit class of people and had proposed solutions to deal with people they regarded as unfit. He also points out that many of those associated with the movement were ``people of good will, many with outstanding credentials as social reformers.'' Carlson further reminds readers that even if societies do not enact eugenics laws, couples planning to have children will still face difficult moral decisions created by the availability of genetic counseling, prenatal genetic testing, and elective abortion. </p><p> Although many may regard the eugenics movement as little more than an unfortunate chapter in human history, Carlson's book reminds us that the idea of an unfit group of people is not likely to fade into history, since it is a common strategy for explaining and responding to humanity's moral, physiological, and psychological imperfections. As we learn more about the genetic basis of disease and gain more control over human health and reproduction, we must also learn to deal with human imperfections without stigmatizing classes or races of people as unfit. <br> <i>David B.

"He wrote for the day, the moment; but these are just the writers whom posterity is apt to put into its pocket." Considered by contemporary critics to be Trollope's greatest novel, The Way We Live Now is a satire of the literary world of London in the 1870s and a bold indictment of the new power of speculative finance in English life. "I was instigated by what I conceived to be the commercial profligacy of the age," Trollope said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; His story concerns Augustus Melmotte, a French swindler and scoundrel, and his daughter, to whom Felix Carbury, adored son of the authoress Lady Carbury, is induced to propose marriage for the sake of securing a fortune. Trollope knew well the difficulties of dealing with editors, publishers, reviewers, and the public; his portrait of Lady Carbury, impetuous, unprincipled, and unswervingly devoted to her own self-promotion, is one of his finest satirical achievements.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; His picture of late nineteenth century England is of a society on the verge of moral bankruptcy, where the traditional virtues of Tory squirearchy, represented by Roger Carbury, prove to be no match for the financial genius of Augustus Melmotte. In The Way We Live Now Trollope combines his talents as a portraitist and his skills as a storyteller to give us life as it was lived more than a hundred years ago.</p><p>Trollope&#39;s 1875 tale of a great financier&#39;s fraudulent machinations in the railway business, and his daughter&#39;s ill-use at the hands of a grasping lover (for whom she steals funds in order to elope) is a classic in the literature of money and a ripping good read as well.In this world of bribes and vendettas, swindling and suicide, in which heiresses are won like gambling stakes, Trollope&#39;s characters embody all the vices: Lady Carbury, a 43-year-old coquette, &#39;false from head to foot&#39;; her son Felix, with the &#39;instincts of a horse, not approaching the higher sympathies of a dog&#39;; and Melmotte, the colossal figure who dominates the book, a &#39;horrid, big, rich scoundrel...a bloated swindler...a vile city ruffian&#39;.</p><h2>The Feminine Mystique</h2><p>An analysis of the position of women in Western society. When published in 1963 it met with an enormous response and led to Friedan being called the mother of the new feminist movement.</p><p>First published in 1963, <i>The Feminine Mystique</i> ignited a revolution that profoundly changed our culture, our conciousness, and our lives. Today it newly penetrates to the heart of isuues determining our lives -- and sounds a call to arms against the very real dangers of a newe feminine mystique in the economic and political turbulence of the 1990s.<p> Three decades later, the underlying issues raised by Betty Friedan strike at the core of the problems women still face at home and in the marketplace. As women continue to struggle for equality, to keep their hard-won gains, to find fulfillment in their careers, marriage and family, <i>The Feminine Mystique</i> remains the seminal conciousness-raising work of our times.</p>Credited with creating the second wave of feminism, Betty Friedan was an activist and writer.

The success of <i>Asking the Right Questions: A Guide to Critical Thinking</i> is a tribute to the sound advice we have received from the many readers who thought we could do better next time around and who told us so. In fact, one of our biggest challenges has been to pick and choose from among the suggestions. </p> <p> Always uppermost in our mind has been the desire to retain the primary attributes of <i>Asking the Right Questions,</i> while adjusting to new emphases in our own thought and the evolving needs of our readers. For instance, while we can always think of dozens of additions that would, we believe, enhance new editions of <i>Asking the Right Questions,</i> we want most of all to keep the book readable and short. We are willing to pay the price of omitting several things that would be apposite in a more weighty treatment of critical thinking because those who adopt or learn from <i>Asking the Right Questions</i> have noted the crispness and cohesion of our approach so frequently. Individual readers who do not see their suggestions included will surely understand that writing for a general audience requires us to omit many valuable components that we would certainly include were we writing for a more specialized group of readers. </p> <p> This new edition, like its predecessors, has been modified while retaining basic framework of a simplified guide to critical thinking. Several new practice passages have been inserted. In addition, we have completely rewritten the fallacies chapter to make it more coherent and to provide new illustrations. But what is particularly fresh about the seventh edition are three new foci: </p> <ol> <li>Emphasizing the positive dimensions of critical thinking so that users will be more eager to use the skills and attitudes they are learning;</li> <li>Reminding readers frequently that each skill is but one part of a critical and constructive process that should culminate in tentative commitment; and</li> <li>Creating a Web site containing multiple, diverse practice opportunities.</li> </ol> <p> Learning critical thinking is neither simple nor easy. But even after critical thinking has been learned to some degree, there is still the challenge of desiring to use a process that can often be seen as rude, mean, or arrogant. None of us wishes to exhibit habits of mind that brand us as obnoxious. Yet at the same time, we do not want to base our behavior solely on the reactions of others to it; otherwise, we would just be a puppet of the crowd. </p> <p> So we need to frame critical thinking in a manner that emphasizes its role in assisting us to make decisions that are both more reflective and caring as well. We learn critical thinking to be helpful to ourselves and to others. Critical thinking prevents us from courses of action that are inconsistent with whom we want to become. In addition, it assists others who are seeking beliefs and commitments built on relatively sound structures of reasoning. In those regards, critical thinking can be an act of friendship, moving others toward more reasonable beliefs and actions. The seventh edition tries to make that point in several contexts. </p> <p> The second new focus in this edition is based on the fear that learning individual steps in any process can prevent our appreciation of the power of the entire process wherein all the steps are used in tandem. <i>Asking the Right Questions</i> builds the critical-thinking process one step at a time; each chapter introduces a particular critical-thinking skill. Subsequent chapters then add to the list of accumulating critical-thinking skills. But the entire rationale for learning the steps of critical thinking is to get ready to use them as a package, a cohesive assemblage of complementary abilities. Using the entire process of critical thinking is the most rewarding pathway to finding better arguments. </p> <p> Finally, one thing that our readers request again and again are more practice materials. We are working with Prentice Hall to respond to that request with this new edition. The Web site for <i>Asking the Right Questions</i> will be organized by chapter and contain practice passages of varying size. In addition, learners also need to see arguments that are relatively strong. Critical thinking can move someone toward cynicism as she or he learns more about the multiple problems that can haunt daily reasoning. Hence, the Web site contains a lengthy, relatively strong argument concerning the efficacy of student evaluations of teaching. We want to highlight on the site what is particularly strong about this argument, to provide readers a model of what is possible when someone tries to reason well. </p> <p> In addition, we wanted to provide on the Web site an illustration of critical analysis that is more realistic than the one provided in the final chapter. While agreeing with the appropriateness of the final chapter as a culmination of the algorithmic process of asking the right questions, several readers have urged us to provide a more realistic illustration. As they correctly point out, it is highly unrealistic to expect to see what is modeled in Chapter 14. We agree. </p> <p> These new directions of <i>Asking the Right Questions</i> are meant to improve what our readers have told us they most want, a book that helps students toward reasonable autonomy. The success of previous editions of this book is potent testimony to our collective curiosity about what to believe. Our minds are under assault by experts and scam artists alike. Sorting among all their claims about what to eat, do, and believe is an incredibly difficult responsibility. We know that we need all the help we can get to protect ourselves from the dangers implicit in nonsense. We want to think carefully before we make a belief our own. </p> <p> From the start of this book's history, we have been motivated by a variety of personal experiences and observations. First, we have been dismayed by the degree to which students and citizens in general increasingly depend on "experts," textbook writers, teachers, lawyers, politicians, journalists, and TV commentators. As the complexity of the world seems to increase at an accelerating rate, there is a greater tendency to become passive absorbers of information, uncritically accepting what is seen and heard. We are concerned that too many of us are not actively making personal choices about what to accept and what to reject. </p> <p> Thus, the need for such a book is now even more pronounced. The use of "sound bites," the popularity of simplistic arguments, and the amount of information to which we are exposed every day have all increased dramatically. To encourage us all to use critical thinking more frequently as an antidote to this "information explosion" is our dream for <i>Asking the Right Questions.</i> </p> <p> Our experience in teaching critical-thinking skills to our students over a number of years has convinced us that when individuals with diverse abilities are taught these skills in a simplified format, they can learn to apply them successfully. In the process, they develop greater confidence in their ability to make rational choices about social issues, even those with which they have formerly had little experience. </p> <p> Thus, we have written a text that does a number of things that other books have failed to do. This text develops an integrated series of question-asking skills that can be applied widely. These skills are discussed in an informal style. (We have written to a general audience, not to any specialized group.) </p> <p> The development of <i>Asking the Right Questions</i> has leaned heavily on our joint experience of 60 years as teachers of critical thinking. Our ideas have evolved in response to numerous classroom experiences with students at many different levels, from freshman to Ph.D. students. </p> <p> These experiences have taught us certain emphases that are particularly effective in learning critical thinking. For instance, we provide many opportunities for the readers to apply their skills and to receive immediate feedback following the practice application. The book is replete with examples of writing devoted to controversial contemporary topics. The breadth of topics introduces the average reader to numerous controversies with which he or she may have little familiarity. The book is coherently organized, in that critical questions are discussed sequentially as the reader progresses from understanding to evaluating. In addition, it integrates cognitive and value dimensions&#x2014;a very important aspect of critical thinking and personal decision making. </p> <p> One feature that deserves to be highlighted is the applicability of <i>Asking the Right Questions</i> to numerous life experiences extending far beyond the classroom. The habits and attitudes associated with critical thinking are transferable to consumer, medical, legal, and general ethical choices. When our surgeon says surgery is needed, it can be life sustaining to seek answers to critical questions. </p> <p> Who would find <i>Asking the Right Questions</i> especially beneficial? Because of our teaching experiences with readers representing many different levels of ability, we have difficulty envisioning any academic course or program for which this book would not be useful. In fact, the first five editions have been used in law, English, pharmacy, philosophy, education, psychology, sociology, religion, and social science courses, as well as in numerous high school classrooms. </p> <p> A few uses for the book seem especially appropriate. Teachers in general education programs may want to begin their courses by assigning it as a coherent response to their students' requests to explain what is expected of them. English courses that emphasize expository writing could use this text both as a format for evaluating arguments prior to constructing an essay and as a checklist of problems that the writer should attempt to avoid as he or she writes. The book is especially functional in courses for training prospective teachers and gr...</p></p><h2>Atlas of Ancient America</h2><p>Text, illustrations, and maps survey the history, art, and archaeology of the original cultures native to North, Central, and South America</p><p>While beginning with the European conquest and ending with Native American survivals, this atlas mostly concerns the prehistoric archaeology of North, Middle, and South America.

In a world full of hope for democratization but wary of government failure, this book offers empirical evidence for the importance of civic community in developing successful institutions. As part of a unique experiment begun in 1970 when Italy created new governments for each of its regions - regions that vary greatly from the standpoint of wealth, social structure, and political leanings - Robert Putnam and his collaborators spent two decades evaluating the performance of these governments in such fields as agriculture, housing, and health services. Their findings were surprising: regions that enjoy effective government in the 1990s have inherited a legacy of civic engagement that can be traced back to the early Middle Ages. Just as Tocqueville traveled to America to try to understand democracy, Putnam and his colleagues draw broad lessons for democratic theory from their twenty-year journey through Italy. Their conclusions challenge the simple-minded thesis of the primacy of economics and the easy optimism of social engineers. Based on dozens of case studies and thousands of interviews with politicians, community leaders, and ordinary citizens, this book illuminates patterns of associationism, trust, and cooperation that facilitate good governance and economic prosperity. It also contributes to the discussion of democracy in the newly freed lands of Eurasia and the developing world and to the gathering debate about how to revitalize democracy in America.<b>Robert D.

It became a college textbook and a foundation for the widespread eugenics movement in the United States. Nearly 100 years later, many of the issues raised by Davenport are again being debated, in different guises. In this new volume, prominent academics discuss themes from Davenport&#39;s book --human genetic variation, mental illness, nature vs. nurture, human evolution--in a contemporary context. Davenport &#39;s original book is reprinted along with the essays. This book will be useful to historians of science as well as those interested in the social implications of human genetics research-past, present, and future.</p><p>In Davenport s Dream, editors Witkowski and Inglis (both from Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory) have compiled contributions from twelve scholars who analyze current research pertaining to some of Davenport s theories. Is there any indication that some forms of mental illness follow a true Mendelian inheritance pattern? How does mitochondrial DNA contribute to eugenics? A facsimile of Davenport s original work is included. This book would be valuable as a basis for discussions in bioethics or social policy courses. Choice --Choice<br><br>The reappearance of this facsimile volume and accompanying commentary makes an important resource for understanding eugenic thought readily available for historians, scientists, and a newly curious public. The Quarterly Review of Biology --The Quarterly Review of Biology<br><br>The title of this stimulating collection of well written essays, Davenport s Dream , relates to his no doubt well intended aspiration that advances in genetics should be directed and applied to improve human existence. Sadly his contribution was almost certainly counter-productive and, as other authors in this text point out even if ethically acceptable, it is difficult to see how eugenics could be applied successfully given the genetic complexity underlying most common human diseases and characteristics. Indeed genetic diversity is widely perceived as desirable if not essential for the future progress and survival of the species, so that any attempt to discriminate against a particular genotype could have adverse consequences in the future. Perhaps the main message of this book is that we should all learn from Davenport s mistakes and remember that the welfare of the individual should never be sacrificed for a greater vision of spurious societal benefit.

Volume One, published in 1989, introduces the basic finite element approximation concepts and thereafter concentrates on simple linear static computations, which still provide the major part of the finite element usage. Special features of this edition include - work on the patch test; the essence of mixed-formulations; the new area of error estimation and adaptivity; and the concluding chapter incorporates a computer system which can be used to carry out numerical calculations for each problem area considered. Volume Two covers diverse applications and extends the power of the finite element method to new areas. It deals with four main topics: the first is that of plate and shell approximation including very recent developments. The second is the general area of non-linear problems where the basic outline of solution methods is presented for a variety of applications. The third topic is the extension into time domain transients where finite element approaches are outlined. The fourth extends the coverage to problems of fluid mechanics where for the first time full element methods for a range of non-self adjoint equations are summarized and applications ranging from high-speed aeronautical applications to shallow water problems are presented.</p><p></p><h2>The Ship That Would Not Die</h2><p>The commander of the Laffey, an American destroyer, documents the ship&#39;s part in the Normandy invasion, her battles in the Pacific, and her resistance under Kamikaze attacks</p><p></p><h2>You Can&#39;t Say That to Me: Stopping the Pain of Verbal Abuse--An 8- Step Program</h2><p>You can't say that to me!

The author overturns the traditional perspective by showing how figurative aspects of language reveal the poetic structure of mind. Ideas and research from psychology, linguistics, philosophy, anthropology, and literary theory are used to establish important links between the poetic structure of thought and everyday use of language. The Poetics of Mind evaluates current philosophical, linguistic, and literary theories of figurative language and relates the empirical work on figurative language understanding to the broader issues concerning the nature of everyday thought and reasoning.</p><p>Ideas and research from psychology, linguistics, philosophy, anthropology and literary theory establish important links between the poetic structure of thought and everyday language usage in this attempt to overturn the traditional view that poetic language requires unique linguistic skills."...accessible to the uninitiated reader and still maintains the highest scholarly standards...Anyone who is interested in the relationship between language and thought should read this book, and they will not be disappointed."

Written by two top experts on the eraMaurice Isserman, a scholar of the Left, and Michael Kazin, a specialist in Right-wing politics and culturethis book provides a compelling tale of this tumultuous era filled with fresh and persuasive insights. Arguing that the period marked the end of the country's two-century-long ascent toward widespread affluence, domestic consensus, and international hegemony, the authors take students on a tour of the turbulent decade, exploring what did and did not change in the 1960s and why American culture and politics have never been the same since. America Divided: The Civil War of the 1960s explains what made the 1960s a decade in which people felt they could make history and why, in the following decades, the history felt so troubling to Americans. They cover such events as the Cuban Missile Crisis and Operation Rolling Thunder, the rise of Motown, Bob Dylan and the Beatles, and the important role played by organizations ranging from the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee to the Campus Crusade for Christ. They also shed some much-needed light on the eras often overlooked rise of the New Right and its far reaching implications which not only offer a critical dimension to the understanding of this period but to the future of America as well. Isserman and Kazin offer the most sophisticated understanding of the key developments of the decade and break new ground with their careful attention to every aspect of the political and cultural spectrum making <em>America Divided: The Civil War of the 1960s</em> an exciting and essential narrative for both students and general readers alike.</p><p>Maurice Isserman, Professor of History, Hamilton College. Michael Kazin, Professor of History, American University.A thoroughly detailed, well-written history of the tumultuous recent past. Historians Isserman (Hamilton College; If I Had a Hammer, 1987) and Kazin (Georgetown Univ.; The Populist Persuasion) take a past-is-a-foreign-country approach to the events of the 1960s. Survivors of the time might get a chuckle at some of the data the authors see the need to explain: The most common drug in the `60s was marijuana, nearly as ubiquitous in youth communities as was bottled beer everywhere else in America. Motown became renowned for its tight orchestrations and catchy lyrics. Martin Luther King Jr. occupied a unique place in American political life. But veterans of the era are evidently not the principal audience for this book, which seems intended for graduate students in American history. They are well served by the authors, who rigorously defend their view that the `60s were in fact a time of civil war, and not merely civil disobedience: The body count in Vietnam and in Americas inner cities, they suggest, are argument enough. This war had its origins in the 1950s, they observe, in a time when a golden age of post-WWII prosperity ran counter to an escalating Cold War, which cost a fortune and led to the economic dislocations and spiraling inflation of the succeeding decade. One campaign in that war, centering on civil rights for ethnic minorities, began a decade earlier in such acts as Lt. Jackie Robinsons refusal in 1944 to sit at the back of a crowded bus. (Robinson would face a court-martial for his act of civil disobedience, and would soon thereafter break the color barrier in major-league baseball.) Yet a third front would open when a substantial number of young Americans rejected the values of their elders and the bankrupt promises of Presidents Johnson and Nixon. All combined, the authors write, to lead America to a period of unwonted civil violence. Isserman, a specialist in leftist politics, and Kazin, a student of modern conservativism, make a solid tag team. Their thoroughgoing research and vivid writing make this a book of interest to students and general readers alike. (45 photos, not seen) -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1999, Kirkus Associates, LP.

He has been the subject of many biographies, several of them more than a thousand pages in length, but all the preceding works have tended toward one extreme of interpretation or the other. This is the first comprehensive scholarly biography of Franco in English that is objective and balanced in its coverage, treating all three major aspects of his life&#x2014;personal, military, and political. The coauthors, both renowned historians of Spain, present a deeply researched account that has made extensive use of the Franco Archive (long inaccessible to historians). They have also conducted in-depth interviews with his only daughter to explain better his family background, personal life, and marital environment, as well as his military and political career.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Franco: A Personal and Political Biography</i> depicts his early life, explains his career and rise to prominence as an army officer who became Europe's youngest interwar brigadier general in 1926, and then discusses his role in the affairs of the troubled Second Spanish Republic (1931&#x2013;36). Stanley G. Payne and Jesï¿½s Palacios examine in detail how Franco became dictator and how his leadership led to victory in the Spanish Civil War that consolidated his regime. They also explore Franco's role in the great repression that accompanied the Civil War&#x2014;resulting in tens of thousands of executions&#x2014;and examine at length his controversial role in World War II.

Jesus Palacios is a noted historian, investigative journalist, and adjunct professor at the University of Madrid.<br>"An intimate portrait of Franco the man, provoking a lively and necessary debate about the nature of the dictator's regime."&#x2015;Julius Ruiz, author of <i>Franco's Justice</i><br><br><br>"Francisco Franco is the only major twentieth-century dictator to die peacefully in his bed&#x2015;after almost four decades in power. His regime was brutal, despicable, and in many respects ineffectual, yet it did not join the Axis powers in World War II and was a transitional type between traditional military dictatorships and more recent totalitarian regimes. This book, impeccably based on the available sources and displaying sober judgment, could well be the definitive work on the subject."&#x2015;Walter Laqueur, author of <i>Fascism: Past, Present, Future</i><br><br><br>"Masterfully combines research on Franco's life and regime with new and unique sources including Franco's private papers and interviews with Franco's only daughter. It will appeal to a broad readership including anyone interested in the history of twentieth-century Spain, the Spanish civil war, and the Franco regime."&#x2015;Joan Maria Thomï¿½s, University Rovira-Virgili, Spain<br><br>&#x201c;This highly readable and extremely insightful biography situates Franco not only in his Spanish context but also in the global context of 20th-century dictatorships.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Wall Street Journal</i><br><br>&#x201c;The authors face their daunting task with redoubtable advantages [including] the respect due to their scholarship and erudition. . . . To write fairly about Franco is a largely thankless, albeit perhaps remunerative, task, appealing only to those who have a stomach for a fight or indifference to blows. . . . Stanley Payne and Jesï¿½s Palacios deserve admiration for taking the risk of saying what little there is to be said on their subject&#x2019;s behalf. Theirs is a fearless book.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Times Literary Supplement</i><br><br><br>&#x201c;Add[s] an intimate glimpse into Franco&#x2019;s personal and family life to the extant historiography of Franco&#x2019;s military career and the political machinations of his regime. . . . The authors successfully take great pains to be objective and balanced as they simultaneously eschew writing a hagiography and situating his seizure of the state within the context of interwar chaos and violence. Recommended, all levels/libraries.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Choice</i><br><br><br>&#x201c;Franco is that dread thing,&nbsp;&#x2018;complex.&#x2019;&nbsp;He will frustrate a desire for black-and-whiteness. . . . The new biography by Stanley G. Payne and Jesï¿½s Palacios will tell you what to think about Franco. Even better, it will tell you <i>how</i> to think about him. That is a huge gift to an interested reader.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>National Review</i><br><br><br>&#x201c;Highly readable, the book is at its heart a biography. . . . The authors do well to demonstrate not only Franco&#x2019;s committed anti-Communism, but his elaborate and exaggerated fear of Freemasons, his reluctance for reform, his growing disillusionment with the Roman Catholic Church after Vatican II, and his sheer inability to comprehend economic policy.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>American Historical Review</i></p><h2>The Living World</h2><p>The Living World is often considered a student favorite.

Richard Rex traces how, in a concentrated burst of creative energy in the few years surrounding his excommunication by Pope Leo X in 1521, this lecturer at an obscure German university developed a startling new interpretation of the Christian faith that brought to an end the dominance of the Catholic Church in Europe. Luther&#x2019;s personal psychology and cultural context played their parts in the whirlwind of change he unleashed. But for the man himself, it was always about the ideas, the truth, and the Gospel.</p><p>Focusing on the most intensely important years of Luther&#x2019;s career, Rex teases out the threads of his often paradoxical and counterintuitive ideas from the tangled thickets of his writings, explaining their significance, their interconnections, and the astonishing appeal they so rapidly developed. Yet Rex also sets these ideas firmly in the context of Luther&#x2019;s personal life, the cultural landscape that shaped him, and the traditions of medieval Catholic thought from which his ideas burst forth.</p><p>Lucidly argued and elegantly written, <i>The Making of Martin Luther</i> is a splendid work of intellectual history that renders Luther&#x2019;s earthshaking yet sometimes challenging ideas accessible to a new generation of readers.</p></p><p><p>"A remarkable piece of writing that will have an enduring influence. With shrewd and canny insights, powerful prose, and wit, Richard Rex offers a persuasive and provocative tour through the early years of the Reformation."<b>--Bruce Gordon, author of <i>John Calvin's "Institutes of the Christian Religion": A Biography</i></b></p><p>"One of the most interesting and original studies of Luther that I've read in my career.

An exciting true story that features real life testimonies of teachers, parents, and kids, as well as political and social commentary, Rebecca&#x2019;s journey leads her to the realization that the only hope for America&#x2019;s schools and families is returning authority to parents and teachers while lessening the grip of state and national unions that:<br> <ul> <li>Promote a culture of fear and bully teachers and parents into silence.</li> <li>Undermine parents&#x2019; authority by sexually, socially, and politically indoctrinating kids.</li> <li>Use the apple-pie image of the PTA as a &#x201c;front&#x201d; to promote a partisan agenda.</li> </ul> <br>These insights and more led Rebecca and nine other teachers to the US Supreme Court where their case, <i>Friedrichs v California Teachers Association, et al</i>., sought to restore the First Amendment rights of all teachers and government employees. They argued no one should be forced to pay fees to abusive, politically driven unions, and were poised to change the very landscape of American education&#x2014;until tragedy struck.<br> <br> Saddened but unbowed, Rebecca started a national movement, <i>For Kids and Country,</i> leading the charge of servant leaders who believe Judeo-Christian values (including kindness) and restoration of the teaching profession&#x2014;possible&nbsp;only by rejecting state and national unions and forming &#x201c;local only&#x201d; associations&#x2014;are the answers to America&#x2019;s woes. She invites you to join them.<br> <br> &#x201c;America&#x2019;s teachers, parents, and kids deserve better,&#x201d; Rebecca writes. &#x201c;If we want freedom, we&#x2019;re going to have to fight for it.&#x201d;</p><p>Rebecca Friedrichs a twenty-eight-year public school teacher, was forced to fund state and national teachers&#x2019; unions whose politics and divisive tactics degraded her profession, our schools, and our national character.<br> <br>Her lawsuit, <i>Friedrichs v California Teachers' Association</i>, which sought to free teachers from forced unionism, was argued before the U.S. Supreme Court in 2016.<br> <br>Poised to rule 5-4 in Rebecca's favor, the Court deadlocked after the death of Justice Scalia.<br> <br>Determined to stop state and national unions from destroying our schools and American values, Rebecca refused to give up.<br> <br><i>Standing Up to Goliath, </i>told through dozens of powerful personal accounts, is Rebecca&#x2019;s expose of bully unions.<br> <br>She&#x2019;s a Prager University host, and founded <i>For Kids and Country</i> a national movement of parents, teachers, students, faith leaders, and citizens uniting to restore our schools and culture."Friedrichs masterfully weaves the personal and the political.

Anthropologists have offered various explanations for the existence of cannibalism, none of which, Peggy Sanday claims, is adequate. In this book she presents a new approach to understanding the phenomenon. Through a detailed examination of ritual cannibalism in selected tribal societies, and a comparison of those cases with others in which the practice is absent, she shows that cannibalism is closely linked to people&#39;s orientation to the world, and that it serves as a concrete device for distinguishing the &#39;cultural self&#39; from the &#39;natural other&#39;. Combining perspectives drawn from the work of Ricoeur, Freud, Hegel, and Jung and from symbolic anthropology, Sanday argues that ritual cannibalism is intimately connected both with the constructs by which the origin and continuity of life are understood and assured from one generation to the next and with the way in which that understanding is used to control the vital forces considered necessary for the cannibalism in a culture derives from basic human attitudes toward life and death, combined with the realities of the material world. As well as making an original contribution to the understanding of the significant human practice, Sanday also develops a theoretical argument of wider relevance to anthropologists, sociologists, and other readers interested in the function and meaning of cannibalism.</p><p>A new approach to understanding the phenomenon of ritual cannibalism through a detailed examination of selected tribal societies demonstrates that the practice is closely linked to people&#39;s orientation to the world, and helps distinguish &#34;cultural self.&#34;Peggy Reeves Sanday is Professor of Anthropology at the University of Pennsylvania.

As a desk reference guide written specifically for CISOs, we hope this book becomes a trusted resource for you, your teams, and your colleagues in the C-suite. The different perspectives can be used as standalone refreshers and the five immediate next steps for each chapter give the reader a robust set of 45 actions based on roughly 100 years of relevant experience that will help you strengthen your cybersecurity programs.</p><p>Bill Bonney, Matt Stamper, and Gary Hayslip met in the summer of 2014 as members of the very inclusive and collaborative cybersecurity community of San Diego, California. Besides being the eighth largest city in the U.S. and a very welcoming community, San Diego is home to several pockets of technological innovation. These include very successful biotechnology, life sciences, and mobile technology industries; a plethora of defense contractors and aerospace research companies; a blossoming startup community in the Internet of Things (IoT) and Cybersecurity; and a thriving academic environment. San Diego is also home to the fewest number of &#x201c;Fortune 500&#x201d; company headquarters, per capita, in the U. S. Each of the authors has enjoyed over 30 years of success in the Information Technology field, but they have very different backgrounds. It became obvious as they got to know each other by participating on panels and speaking at industry events that these different backgrounds brought diverse and complementary perspectives to the problems the cybersecurity community currently faces. What started as a panel discussion on the role of the modern CISO sparked such a lively audience discussion that the authors began to consider turning into a book for new CISOs and CISOs at mid-size firms in particular.</p><h2>The Mexican Dream: Or, The Interrupted Thought of Amerindian Civilizations</h2><p><p>Winner of the 2008 Nobel Prize for Literature, J. M. G. Le Clï¿½zio here conjures the consciousness of Mexico, powerfully evoking the dreams that made and unmade an ancient culture. Le Clï¿½zio&#x2019;s haunting book takes us into the dream that was the religion of the Aztecs, a religion whose own apocalyptic visions anticipated the coming of the Spanish conquerors. Here the dream of the conquistadores rises before us, too, the glimmering idea of gold drawing Europe into the Mexican dream.

A widely respected French novelist who for many years has studied pre-Columbian Mexico, Le Clezio imagined how the thought of early Indian civilizations might have evolved if not for the interruption of European conquest. In an unprecedented way, his book takes us into the dream that was the religion of the Aztecs, which in its own apocalyptic visions anticipated the coming of the Spanish conquerors. Here the dream of the conquistadores rises before us, too, the glimmering idea of gold drawing Europe into the Mexican dream. Against the religion and thought of the Aztecs and the Tarascans and the Europeans in Mexico, Le Clezio also shows us those of the &#34;barbarians&#34; of the north, the nomadic Indians beyond the pale of the Aztec frontier. Finally, Le Clezio&#39;s book is a dream of the present, a meditation on what in Amerindian civilizations - in their language, in their way of telling tales, of wanting to survive their own destruction - moved the poet, playwright, and actor Antonin Artaud and motivates Le Clezio in this book. The author&#39;s deep identification with pre-Columbian cultures, whose faith told them the wheel of time would bring their gods and their beliefs back to them, finds fitting expression in this extraordinary book, which brings the dream around.<p></p><p><i></i></p><p></p><b>J.

This book precisely reflects the way science education should be, especially at the introductory level." --From the foreword</p><br><p> Here is a collection of physics demonstrations costing very little to produce yet illustrating key concepts in amazingly simple and playful ways. Intended for instructors, students, and curious lay readers, these demonstrations make use of easily accessible, everyday items: food coloring and glycerine swirled and then "unmixed" in a container demonstrate aspects of the entropy law; raw eggs thrown with full force at a sheet but not breaking illustrate Newton's second law (f=ma); and the reflection off a glass Christmas tree ball is the focus of an explanation on "turning the world inside out." Many of the demonstrations are either new or include innovative twists on old ideas, as in the author's simplified version of the classic "Monkey and Hunter" problem, which substitutes "diluted gravity" on an inclined plane for large apparatus. Each demonstration outlines the objective, the equipment needed, and the procedure, including, in many instances, ways for a teacher to perform the demonstration on an overhead projector. Throughout the book concrete examples are accompanied by enough theoretical background to enhance a reader's basic understanding of physical principles. Lab instructors will find that demonstrations containing a quantitative component work well as mini- experiments and as ways to illustrate the results of calculations. These diverse and flexible demonstrations will serve a wide range of educational levels, from middle school physical science to university physics.</p></p><p></p><h2>C. S. Lewis and His Circle: Essays and Memoirs from the Oxford C.S. Lewis Society</h2><p>For over thirty years, the Oxford C. S. Lewis Society has met weekly in the medieval colleges of the University of Oxford. During that time, it has hosted as speakers nearly all those still living who were associated with the Inklings--the Oxford literary circle led by C. S. Lewis--as well as authors and thinkers of a prominence that nears Lewis's own.<br><br><i>C. S. Lewis and His Circle</i> offers the reader a chance to join this unique group. Roger White has worked with Society past presidents Brendan and Judith Wolfe to select the most important talks, which are here made available to the wider public for the first time. They exemplify the best of traditional academic essays, thoughtful memoirs, and informal reminiscences about C. S. Lewis and his circle. The reader will reimagine Lewis's Cosmic Trilogy with former Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams, read philosopher Elizabeth Anscombe's final word on Lewis's arguments for Christianity, hear the Reverend Peter Bide's memories of marrying Lewis and Joy Davidman in an Oxford hospital, and learn about Lewis's Narnia Chronicles from his former secretary.<br><br>Representing the finest of both personal and scholarly engagement with C. S. Lewis and the Inklings, the talks collected here set a new tone for engagement with this iconic Oxford literary circle--a tone close to Lewis's own Oxford-bred sharpness and wryness, seasoned with good humor and genuine affection for C. S. Lewis and his circle.</p><p><br><b>Roger White</b> is curator of the Inklings Special Collection for the University Libraries as well as Professor of Ministry for the Seminary at Azusa Pacific University in Azusa, California. <br><br><b>Judith Wolfe </b>is Lecturer (Associate Professor) in Theology and the Arts at the University of St. Andrews, Scotland.

Just when you might have thought there wasn't much more to say about Lewis, Tolkien, and their friends, we have a rich and diverse collection of reflections, reminiscences, expositions, and engagements from angles both expected and unexpected. By retaining the spoken style of the original contributions to the Oxford C. S. Lewis Society (not quite a new Inklings, not quite a new Socratic Club, but sharing the heritage of both), the editors give us the sense that we are there in Oxford, thinking through issues old and new, always being challenged to fresh visions of literature, faith, and a hundred other topics. There is here much to ponder, much to praise." --Rt. Revd. Prof. N. T. Wright, St. Mary's College, St. Andrews <br><p></p><br>"Among the many worthwhile studies of C. S. Lewis which have been published in recent years, this will prove to be among the most important.

Ammons: Volume 1 1955-1977</h2><p><p><strong>&#x201c;One of the great American poets . . . he sounds like nobody else.&#x201d;&#x2015;Helen Vendler</strong></p><p>&#x201c;So I said I am Ezra / and the wind whipped my throat / gaming for the sounds of my voice. . . .&#x201d; So begins one of the most remarkable oeuvres in the history of American poetry. <em>The Complete Poems of A. R. Ammons, Volume I</em> presents the first half of Archie Randolph Ammons&#x2019;s long career, including the complete texts of his three book-length poems from that period: the verse diary <em>Tape for the Turn of the Year</em>, the Bollingen Prize&#x2013;winning <em>Sphere: The Form of a Motion</em>, and the daring kaleidoscope of <em>The Snow Poems</em>, which late in life Ammons said of all his long poems was his favorite.</p><p>Here are many of Ammons&#x2019;s most widely celebrated lyrics and meditations, including &#x201c;Corsons Inlet,&#x201d; &#x201c;Still,&#x201d; &#x201c;Gravelly Run,&#x201d; and &#x201c;The City Limits.&#x201d; Others are more directly inspired by his roots in the rural south, among them &#x201c;Nelly Myers,&#x201d; &#x201c;Silver,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Mule Song.&#x201d; Here too are conversations with mountains (as in &#x201c;Classic&#x201d; and &#x201c;Mountain Talk&#x201d;) and exchanges with the wind (&#x201c;The Wide Land&#x201d; and &#x201c;Mansion&#x201d;), materialist explanations of reality (&#x201c;Mechanism&#x201d; and &#x201c;Catalyst&#x201d;) and prayers (such as the several poems titled &#x201c;Hymn&#x201d;). A poet drawn to theorizing about poetry, Ammons offers both sophisticated discussions of the art (as in &#x201c;Poetics&#x201d; and &#x201c;Essay on Poetics&#x201d;) and disarming assurance: &#x201c;I believe in fun.&#x201d;</p><p>The text of each poem has been established after careful consideration of Ammons&#x2019;s manuscripts and other prepublication materials. Endnotes detail the poems&#x2019; composition and publication histories, and also helpfully annotate references made within the poems.

After a very tumultuous childhood, Dickens finally succeeded in getting his first story in a London periodical. As the number of his published works increased, so did his fame. Although he died in 1870, Dickens works are some of the most famous written works in the English language.</p><h2>The Eustace Diamonds</h2><p>The central plot of &#34;The Eustace Diamonds&#34; (1872) involves the theft and ultimate discovery of a diamond necklace - the Eustace family heirloom. A splendid sense of the absurd permeates the novel and allows Trollope to examine &#34;truth&#34; in may contexts and at many levels of seriousness. Lizzie&#39;s unscrupulous lies do not prevent her final exposure, and it is, as Stephen Gill says in his Introduction, &#34;this honesty, this clarity of vision that places Trollope with the greatest social novelists of the nineteenth century, with Dickens, Thackeray, and George Eliot.&#34;</p><p>Anthony Trollope&#39;s celebrated Parliamentary novels, of which The Eustace Diamonds (1873) is the third and most famous, are at once unfailingly amusing social comedies, melodramas of greed and deception, and precise nature studies of the political animal in its mid-Victorian habitat. With its purloined jewels, its conniving, resilient, mercenary heroine, and its partiality for the human spectacle in all its complexity, The Eustace Diamonds is a splendid example of Trollope&#39;s art at its most assured.<p><strong>Anthony Trollope </strong>(1815-1882) grew up in London. He inherited his mother's ambition to write and was famously disciplined in the development of his craft. His first novel was published in 1847 while he was working in Ireland as a surveyor for the General Post Office. He wrote series of books set in the English countryside as well as those set in the political life, works that show great psychological penetration. One of his greatest strengths was his ability to re-create in his fiction his own vision of the social structures of Victorian England. The author of forty-seven novels, he was one of the most prolific and respected English novelists of the Victorian era.</p></p><h2>The Little Book of Bull&#39;s Eye Investing: Finding Value, Generating Absolute Returns, and Controlling Risk in Turbulent Markets</h2><p>To make money in this troubled economy you need to understand where the markets are headed, not where they?ve been.

It is at once a Jewish book and a philosophical one: Jewish because it takes its material from the literary tradition that extends from the bible to the rabbis to the great medieval philosophers; philosophical because it studies that material in order to construct a worldview that is rational in the broadest sense of the term. This edition reprints a 1972 introduction by Leo Strauss and includes an essay on the work by Steven Schwarzchild. A new introduction by Kenneth R. Seeskin situates Cohen's masterwork in the history of modern philosophical and religious thought.<br></p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>Houghton Mifflin Social Studies: Practice Book Level 5 US History</h2><p>Book by HOUGHTON MIFFLIN</p><p></p><h2>American Politics Today (Fifth Edition)</h2><p><p><strong>How politics <em>really</em> works and why it matters.</strong></p> The Fifth Edition of <em>American Politics Today</em> is designed to show students the reality of politics today and how it connects to their own lives.

Notes from Underground and Other Stories is a comprehensive collection of Dostoevsky&#39;s short fiction. Many of these stories, like his great novels, reveal his special sympathy for the solitary and dispossessed, explore the same complex psychological issues and subtly combine rich characterization and philosophical meditations on the (often) dark areas of the human psyche, all conveyed in an idiosyncratic blend of deadly seriousness and wild humour. In Notes from Underground, the Underground Man casually dismantles utilitarianism and celebrates in its stead a perverse but vibrant masochism. A Christmas Tree and a Wedding recounts the successful pursuit of a young girl by a lecherous old man. In Bobok, one Ivan Ivanovitch listens in on corpses gossiping in a cemetery and ends up deploring their depravity. In A Gentle Spirit, the narrator describes his dawning recognition that he is responsible for his wife&#39;s suicide. In short, as a commentator on spiritual stagnation, Dostoevsky has no equal.</p><p>Designed for school districts, educators, and students seeking to maximize performance on standardized tests, Webster&#x2019;s paperbacks take advantage of the fact that classics are frequently assigned readings in English courses.

One of the most remarkable characters in literature, the unnamed narrator is a former official who has defiantly withdrawn into an underground existence. In full retreat from society, he scrawls a passionate, obsessive, self-contradictory narrative that serves as a devastating attack on social utopianism and an assertion of man's essentially irrational nature.<br>Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky, whose Dostoevsky translations have become the standard, give us a brilliantly faithful edition of this classic novel, conveying all the tragedy and tormented comedy of the original.</p><h2>Treasure Island (Puffin Pixels)</h2><p><b>Embrace your inner geek with Puffin Pixels<br><br>Puffin Pixels&nbsp;</b>is a collection of classics featuring pixelated, 8-bit video game cover artwork in the Minecraft style.&nbsp;<br><br>Following the demise of bloodthirsty buccaneer Captain Flint, young Jim Hawkins finds himself with the key to a fortune.

He lives in Sussex, England.<b>Chapter I<br><br>The Old Sea Dog at the "Admiral Benbow"</b><br><br>Squire Trelawney, Dr. Livesey, and the rest of these gentlemen having asked me to write down the whole particulars about Treasure Island, from the beginning to the end, keeping nothing back but the bearings of the island, and that only because there is still treasure not yet lifted, I take up my pen in the year of grace 17-, and go back to the time when my father kept the "Admiral Benbow" inn, and the brown old seaman, with the sabre cut, first took up his lodging under our roof.<br><br>I remember him as if it were yesterday, as he came plodding to the inn door, his sea-chest following behind him in a hand-barrow; a tall, strong, heavy, nut-brown man; his tarry pigtail falling over the shoulders of his soiled blue coat; his hands ragged and scarred, with black, broken nails; and the sabre cut across one cheek, a dirty, livid white. I remember him looking round the cove and whistling to himself as he did so, and then breaking out in that old sea-song that he sang so often afterwards:-<br><br>"Fifteen men on the dead man's chest-<br><br>Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!"<br><br>in the high, old tottering voice that seemed to have been tuned and broken at the capstan bars. Then he rapped on the door with a bit of stick like a handspike that he carried, and when my father appeared, called roughly for a glass of rum. This, when it was brought to him, he drank slowly, like a connoisseur, lingering on the taste, and still looking about him at the cliffs and up at our signboard.<br><br>"This is a handy cove," says he, at length; "and a pleasant sittyated grog-shop. Much company, mate?"<br><br>My father told him no, very little company, the more was the pity.<br><br>"Well, then," said he, "this is the berth for me. Here you, matey," he cried to the man who trundled the barrow; "bring up alongside and help up my chest. I'll stay here a bit," he continued. "I'm a plain man; rum and bacon and eggs is what I want, and that head up there for to watch ships off. What you mought call me? You mought call me captain. Oh, I see what you're at-there;" and he threw down three or four gold pieces on the threshold. "You can tell me when I've worked through that," says he, looking as fierce as a commander.<br><br>And, indeed, bad as his clothes were, and coarsely as he spoke, he had none of the appearance of a man who sailed before the mast; but seemed like a mate or skipper, accustomed to be obeyed or to strike. The man who came with the barrow told us the mail had set him down the morning before at the "Royal George;" that he had inquired what inns there were along the coast, and hearing ours well spoken of, I suppose, and described as lonely, had chosen it from the others for his place of residence. And that was all we could learn of our guest.<br><br>He was a very silent man by custom. All day he hung round the cove, or upon the cliffs, with a brass telescope; all evening he sat in a corner of the parlour next the fire, and drank rum and water very strong. Mostly he would not speak when spoken to; only look up sudden and fierce, and blow through his nose like a fog-horn; and we and the people who came about our house soon learned to let him be. Every day, when he came back from his stroll, he would ask if any seafaring men had gone by along the road? At first we thought it was the want of company of his own kind that made him ask this question; but at last we began to see he was desirous to avoid them. When a seaman put up at the "Admiral Benbow" (as now and then some did, making by the coast road for Bristol), he would look in at him through the curtained door before he entered the parlour; and he was always sure to be as silent as a mouse when any such was present. For me, at least, there was no secret about the matter; for I was, in a way, a sharer in his alarms. He had taken me aside one day, and promised me a silver fourpenny on the first of every month if I would only keep my "weather-eye open for a seafaring man with one leg," and let him know the moment he appeared. Often enough, when the first of the month came round, and I applied to him for my wage, he would only blow through his nose at me, and stare me down; but before the week was out he was sure to think better of it, bring me my fourpenny piece, and repeat his orders to look out for "the seafaring man with one leg."<br><br>How that personage haunted my dreams, I need scarcely tell you. On stormy nights, when the wind shook the four corners of the house, and the surf roared along the cove and up the cliffs, I would see him in a thousand forms, and with a thousand diabolical expressions. Now the leg would be cut off at the knee, now at the hip; now he was a monstrous kind of a creature who had never had but the one leg, and that in the middle of his body. To see him leap and run and pursue me over hedge and ditch was the worst of nightmares. And altogether I paid pretty dear for my monthly fourpenny piece, in the shape of these abominable fancies.<br><br>But though I was so terrified by the idea of the seafaring man with one leg, I was far less afraid of the captain himself than anybody else who knew him. There were nights when he took a deal more rum and water than his head would carry; and then he would sometimes sit and sing his wicked, old, wild sea-songs, minding nobody; but sometimes he would call for glasses round, and force all the trembling company to listen to his stories or bear a chorus to his singing. Often I have heard the house shaking with "Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum;" all the neighbours joining in for dear life, with the fear of death upon them, and each singing louder than the other, to avoid remark. For in these fits he was the most over-riding companion ever known; he would slap his hand on the table for silence all round; he would fly up in a passion of anger at a question, or sometimes because none was put, and so he judged the company was not following his story. Nor would he allow any one to leave the inn till he had drunk himself sleepy and reeled off to bed.<br><br>His stories were what frightened people worst of all. Dreadful stories they were; about hanging, and walking the plank, and storms at sea, and the Dry Tortugas, and wild deeds and places on the Spanish Main. By his own account he must have lived his life among some of the wickedest men that God ever allowed upon the sea; and the language in which he told these stories shocked our plain country people almost as much as the crimes that he described. My father was always saying the inn would be ruined, for people would soon cease coming there to be tyrannised over and put down, and sent shivering to their beds; but I really believe his presence did us good. People were frightened at the time, but on looking back they rather liked it; it was a fine excitement in a quiet country life; and there was even a party of the younger men who pretended to admire him, calling him a "true sea-dog," and a "real old salt," and such like names, and saying there was the sort of man that made England terrible at sea.<br><br>In one way, indeed, he bade fair to ruin us; for he kept on staying week after week, and at last month after month, so that all the money had been long exhausted, and still my father never plucked up the heart to insist on having more. If ever he mentioned it, the captain blew through his nose so loudly, that you might say he roared, and stared my poor father out of the room. I have seen him wringing his hands after such a rebuff, and I am sure the annoyance and the terror he lived in must have greatly hastened his early and unhappy death.<br><br>All the time he lived with us the captain made no change whatever in his dress but to buy some stockings from a hawker. One of the cocks of his hat having fallen down, he let it hang from that day forth, though it was a great annoyance when it blew. I remember the appearance of his coat, which he patched himself up-stairs in his room, and which, before the end, was nothing but patches. He never wrote or received a letter, and he never spoke with any but the neighbours, and with these, for the most part, only when drunk on rum. The great sea-chest none of us had ever seen open.<br><br>He was only once crossed, and that was towards the end, when my poor father was far gone in a decline that took him off. Dr. Livesey came late one afternoon to see the patient, took a bit of dinner from my mother, and went into the parlour to smoke a pipe until his horse should come down from the hamlet, for we had no stabling at the old "Benbow." I followed him in, and I remember observing the contrast the neat, bright doctor, with his powder as white as snow, and his bright, black eyes and pleasant manners, made with the coltish country folk, and above all, with that filthy, heavy, bleared scarecrow of a pirate of ours, sitting far gone in rum, with his arms on the table. Suddenly he-the captain, that is-began to pipe up his eternal song:-<br><br>"Fifteen men on the dead man's chest-<br><br>Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!<br><br>Drink and the devil had done for the rest-<br><br>Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!"<br><br>At first I had supposed "the dead man's chest" to be that identical big box of his up-stairs in the front room, and the thought had been mingled in my nightmares with that of the one-legged seafaring man. But by this time we had all long ceased to pay any particular notice to the song; it was new, that night, to nobody but Dr. Livesey, and on him I observed it did not produce an agreeable effect, for he looked up for a moment quite angrily before he went on with his talk to old Taylor, the gardener, on a new cure for the rheumatics. In the meantime, the captain gradually brightened up at his own music, and at last flapped his hand upon the table before him in a way we all knew to mean-silence. The voices stopped at once, all but Dr. Livesey's; he went on as before, speaking clear and kind, and drawing briskly at his pipe between every word or two. The captain glared at him for a while, flapped his hand again, glared still harder, and at last broke out with a villainous, low oath: "Silence, there, between decks!"<br><br>"Were you addressing me, sir?" says the doctor; and when the ruffian had told him, with another oath, that this was so, "I have only one thing to say to you, sir," replies the doctor, "that if you keep on drinking rum, the world will soon be quit of a very dirty scoundrel!"<br><br>The old fellow's fury was awful. He sprang to his feet, drew and opened a sailor's clasp-knife, and, balancing it open on the palm of his hand, threatened to pin the doctor to the wall.<br><br>The doctor never so much as moved. He spoke to him, as before, over his shoulder, and in the same tone of voice; rather high, so that all the room might hear, but perfectly calm and steady:-<br><br>"If you do not put that knife this instant in your pocket, I promise, upon my honour, you shall hang at the next assizes."<br><br>Then followed a battle of looks between them; but the captain soon knuckled under, put up his weapon, and resumed his seat, grumbling like a beaten dog.<br><br>"And now, sir," continued the doctor, "since I now know there's such a fellow in my district, you may count I'll have an eye upon you day and night. I'm not a doctor only; I'm a magistrate; and if I catch a breath of complaint against you, if it's only for a piece of incivility like to-night's, I'll take effectual means to have you hunted down and routed out of this. Let that suffice."<br><br>Soon after Dr. Livesey's horse came to the door, and he rode away; but the captain held his peace that evening, and for many evenings to come.<br><br>chapter II<br><br>Black Dog Appears<br><br>and Disappears<br><br>It was not very long after this that there occurred the first of the mysterious events that rid us at last of the captain, though not, as you will see, of his affairs. It was a bitter cold winter, with long, hard frosts and heavy gales; and it was plain from the first that my poor father was little likely to see the spring. He sank daily, and my mother and I had all the inn upon our hands; and were kept busy enough, without paying much regard to our unpleasant guest.<br><br>It was one January morning, very early-a pinching, frosty morning-the cove all grey with hoar-frost, the ripple lapping softly on the stones, the sun still low and only touching the hilltops and shining far to seaward. The captain had risen earlier than usual, and set out down the beach, his cutlass swinging under the broad skirts of the old blue coat, his brass telescope under his arm, his hat tilted back upon his head. I remember his breath hanging like smoke in his wake as he strode off, and the last sound I heard of him, as he turned the big rock, was a loud snort of indignation, as though his mind was still running upon Dr. Livesey.<br><br>Well, mother was up-stairs with father; and I was laying the breakfast-table against the captain's return, when the parlour door opened, and a man stepped in on whom I had never set my eyes before. He was a pale, tallowy creature, wanting two fingers of the left hand; and, though he wore a cutlass, he did not look much like a fighter. I had always my eye open for seafaring men, with one leg or two, and I remember this one puzzled me. He was not sailorly, and yet he had a smack of the sea about him too.</p><h2>A First Course in the Finite Element Method</h2><p>A First Course in the Finite Element Analysis provides a simple, basic approach to the finite element method that can be understood by both undergraduate and graduate students. It does not have the usual prerequisites (such as structural analysis) required by most available texts in this area. The book is written primarily as a basic learning tool for the undergraduate student in civil and mechanical engineering whose main interest is in stress analysis and heat transfer. The text is geared toward those who want to apply the finite element method as a tool to solve practical physical problems. This revised fourth edition includes the addition of a large number of new problems (including SI problems), an appendix for mechanical and thermal properties, and more civil applications.</p><p>Daryl L. Logan is Professor of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Platteville. He received his Ph.D. in 1972 from the University of Illinois -- Chicago.

He holds a Professional Engineer&#39;s License in the state of Indiana."Logan does a very good job of keeping things simple and straight forward. Fairly well written using a simple approach without extensive theoretical and mathematical theory. The text is very complete."<br><br>"Logan has a very easy-to-read style, while retaining the precision and clarity of engineering topics without being dry."<br><br>"The author presented topics in a simple and easy-to-follow way and provided subsequently proper derivation or illustration to enhance students' understanding. I cannot find a textbook which is better than this one in the field of finite element method."</p><h2>Who Killed Hammarskjold?: The UN, the Cold War and White Supremacy in Africa</h2><p>One of the outstanding mysteries of the twentieth century, and one with huge political resonance, is the death of Dag Hammarskjold and his UN team in a plane crash in central Africa in 1961. Just minutes after midnight, his aircraft plunged into thick forest in the British colony of Northern Rhodesia (Zambia), abruptly ending his mission to bring peace to the Congo. Across the world, many suspected sabotage, accusing the multi-nationals and the governments of Britain, Belgium, the USA and South Africa of involvement in the disaster. These suspicions have never gone away.British High Commissioner Lord Alport was waiting at the airport when the aircraft crashed nearby. He bizarrely insisted to the airport management that Hammarskjold had flown elsewhere - even though his aircraft was reported overhead. This postponed a search for so long that the wreckage of the plane was not found for fifteen hours. White mercenaries were at the airport that night too, including the South African pilot Jerry Puren, whose bombing of Congolese villages led, in his own words, to &#39;flaming huts ...destruction and death&#39;. These soldiers of fortune were backed by Sir Roy Welensky, Prime Minister of the Rhodesian Federation, who was ready to stop at nothing to maintain white rule and thought the United Nations was synonymous with the Nazis. The Rhodesian government conducted an official inquiry, which blamed pilot error. But as this book will show, it was a massive cover-up that suppressed and dismissed a mass of crucial evidence, especially that of African eye-witnesses. A subsequent UN inquiry was unable to rule out foul play - but had no access to the evidence to show how and why. Now, for the first time, this story can be told. Who Killed Hammarskjold follows the author on her intriguing and often frightening journey of research to Zambia, South Africa, the USA, Sweden, Norway, Britain, France and Belgium, where she unearthed a mass of new and hitherto secret documentary and photographic evidence.</p><p></p><h2>Chiura Obata: An American Modern</h2><p>Chiura Obata (1885&#x2013;1975) was one of the most significant Japanese American artists working on the West Coast in the last century. Born in Okayama, Japan, Obata emigrated to the United States in 1903 and embarked on a seven-decade career that saw the enactment of anti-immigration laws and the mass incarceration of Japanese Americans during World War II. But Obata emerged as a leading figure in the Northern California artistic communities, serving not only as an influential art professor at UC Berkeley for nearly twenty years, but also as a founding director of art schools in the internment camps. With a prodigious and expansive oeuvre, Obata&#x2019;s seemingly effortless mastery of, and productive engagement with, diverse techniques, styles, and traditions defy the dichotomous categorizations of American/European and Japanese/Asian art. His faith in the power of art, his devotion to preserving the myriad grandeur of what he called &#x201c;Great Nature,&#x201d; and his compelling personal story as an immigrant <i>and</i> an American are all as relevant to our contemporary moment as ever.<br> &nbsp;<br> This catalogue is the first book surveying Chiura Obata&#x2019;s rich and varied body of work that includes over 100 beautiful images, many of which have never been published. It also showcases a selection of Obata&#x2019;s writings and a rare 1965 interview with the artist. The scholarly essays by ShiPu Wang and the other contributors illuminate the intense and productive cross-cultural negotiations that Obata&#x2019;s life and work exemplify, in the context of both American modernism and the early twentieth-century U.S. racio-ethnic relations&#x2014;a still-understudied area in American art historical scholarship.<br> &nbsp;<br> Published in association with the Art, Design and Architecture Museum, UC Santa Barbara.<br> &nbsp;<br> Exhibition dates:<br> Art, Design and Architecture Museum, UC Santa Barbara: January 13&#x2013;April 29, 2018<br> Utah Museum of Fine Arts, Salt Lake City: May 25&#x2013;September 2, 2018<br> Okayama Prefectural Museum of Art, Okayama, Japan: January 18&#x2013;March 10, 2019<br> Crocker Art Museum, Sacramento: June 23&#x2013;September 29, 2019<br> Smithsonian American Art Museum, Washington, D.C.: November 27, 2019&#x2013;May 25, 2020</p><p><b>ShiPu Wang</b> is Professor of Art History and Visual Culture, Founding Faculty of the Global Arts Studies Program, and Founding Director of UCM Art Gallery at the University of California, Merced.

She is happy to share the aphid-covered bush on which she is born with her 150 brothers and sisters. As she doesn't yet have wings, her defenses against predators include pretending to be a stick and blending in with her environment using camouflage. P. Mantis sheds her skin several times as she grows quickly over the course of the summer. When the aphids are gone, P. Mantis snacks on other insects, including her own siblings. When her wings finally come in, P. Mantis can move about more freely, but there are many dangers to avoid&#x2014;spider webs, flying bats and birds, and other hungry creatures. In October, P. Mantis returns to the bush where she was born to lay her own egg case, which will hatch in the spring. As winter approaches, she settles into a deep sleep. Meisel uses gorgeous, vividly painted illustrations and a gentle text to share the story of the life cycle of a praying mantis. The book is formatted like a series of first-person journal entries, and it is easy to follow the journey of the young mantid. Children will learn the time line for each developmental stage that the insect goes through. Although the circle of life can be harsh at times, this tale is told in a light and even humorous way. Back matter is chock-full of facts that will pique the interest of those eager to learn more.

This remarkable work delineates clear-cut implications for doing therapy and for conceptualizing the therapeutic process. <br>The theory extends and develops concepts that Freud introduced in his later writings. It assumes that psychopathology stems from certain grim, unconscious, pathogenic beliefs that the patient acquires by inference from early traumatic experiences. The patient suffers unconsciously from these beliefs and the feelings of guilt, shame, and remorse that stem from them. He is, therefore, powerfully motivated unconsciously to change them. Moreover, the patient is able to exert considerable control over unconscious mental life and, indeed, to make and carry out unconscious plans. He works unconsciously throughout his treatment to change pathogenic beliefs, both by testing them in relation to the analyst and by using insights conveyed by the analyst's interpretations. <br>Since the theory is close to observation it enables the clinician to monitor the patient's progress--to understand, throughout the treatment, how the patient improves, or is set back, by the analyst's interventions. The quantitative, empirical research presented bears directly on this theory. It offers strong evidence that the patient exerts control over the emergence of previously repressed mental contents, bringing them to consciousness when he unconsciously decides he may safely experience them. Supporting the hypothesis that the patient tests pathogenic beliefs throughout treatment in an effort to disconfirm them, it shows that the patient is very likely to respond favorably to interpretations that he can use in his struggle to disconfirm his pathogenic beliefs--but unfavorably to interpretations he cannot use for this purpose. <br>A model of how rigorous psychoanalytic research can both sharpen and modify theoretical constructs and also lend support to a clinical approach, this distinguished volume will be valued by theoreticians, clinicians, researchers, and anyone interested in how the mind works. It provides a clear, accessible, and empirically testable approach to psychoanalytic practice. <br></p><p>Joseph Weiss is a training analyst at the San Francisco Psychoanalytic Institute, Clinical Professor of Psychiatry at the University of California Medical Center in San Francisco, and codirector of the San Francisco Psychotherapy Research Group.

New second edition cases include the deadly police assault on New Orleans' Danziger Bridge after Hurricane Katrina; the deaths of Amadou Diallo and Trayvon Martin; and Bernard Kerik's fall from 9/11 hero to federal prisoner. Highlight cases that remain from the first edition include the Jon Benet Ramsey murder investigation and the conflagrations that ended the sieges in Waco and at the MOVE house in Philadelphia. These human tragedies and organizational debacles serve as starting points for exploring how common structural and cultural fault lines in police organizations set the stage for major failures.<br>The author provides a framework for sorting through these cases to help readers recognize the distinct roles of operational mechanics, organizational structures, rank and file culture and executive hubris in making criminal justice agencies vulnerable to failure. The book examines how dysfunctions such as institutional racism, sexual harassment, systems abuse and renegade enforcement become established and then readily blossom into major scandals.<br><i>Why Law Enforcement Organizations Fail</i> also shows how managers and oversight officials can spot malignant individuals, identify perverse incentives, neutralize deviant cultures and recognize when reigning managerial philosophies or governing policies are producing diminishing or negative returns.<br>This book is jargon-free and communicates plainly with students and criminal justice professionals. This is a highly-teachable book that also provides pragmatic long-term guidance for how to deal with crises, prevent their recurrence and restore organizational legitimacy.

The book of Isaiah has been the object of more scholarly interest over the past two or three decades than during the preceding century. At the same time, much of the received wisdom on the formation of the book has been called into question, including such matters as the date of its several components, the standard tripartite division, the role (if any) to be assigned to the prophet Isaiah himself, and the passages dealing with the anonymous Servant of the Lord. A great deal of effort has been, and continues to be, expended in exploring new approaches to the book, both within the conventional critical methodologies and beyond them.<br><br>This commentary by Joseph Blenkinsopp on the first thirty-nine chapters of the book, the first of a three-volume commentary on Isaiah, is written from a critical perspective in the belief that only in this way can these texts be given the opportunity to say what they have to say&#x2015;and also in the conviction that what they have to say still retains its transforming power for those willing to listen attentively today. The result is a commentary of unequaled brilliance and insight that will stand as the definitive study of one of the Hebrew Bible&#x2019;s most compelling and elusive books.</p></p><p><p><b>Joseph Blenkinsopp</b> is currently John A.

Schneider argues that the study of a highly differentiated society such as our own may be more revealing of the nature of kinship than the study of anthropologically more familiar, but less differentiated societies. He goes to the heart of the ideology of relations among relatives in America by locating the underlying features of the definition of kinship&#x2014;nature vs. law, substance vs. code. One of the most significant features of <i>American Kinship</i>, then, is the explicit development of a theory of culture on which the analysis is based, a theory that has since proved valuable in the analysis of other cultures. For this Phoenix edition, Schneider has written a substantial new chapter, responding to his critics and recounting the charges in his thought since the book was first published in 1968.</p></p><p><b>David M.

Now behavior analysts work in a variety of settings, from clinics and schools to workplaces. Especially since their practice often involves aversive stimuli or punishment, they confront many special ethical challenges. Recently, the Behavior Analysis Certification Board codified a set of ten fundamental ethical guidelines to be followed by all behavior analysts and understood by all students and trainees seeking certification.<br><br>This book shows readers how to follow the BACB guidelines in action. The authors first describe core ethical principles and then explain each guideline in detail, in easily comprehensible, everyday language. The text is richly illuminated by more than a hundred vivid case scenarios about which the authors pose, and later answer questions for readers.

Attentive to nuance while engagingly straightforward, Walzer examines the laws, the histories, the prophecies, and the wisdom of the ancient biblical writers and discusses their views on such central political questions as justice, hierarchy, war, the authority of kings and priests, and the experience of exile.</p><p>Because there are many biblical writers with differing views, pluralism is a central feature of biblical politics. Yet pluralism, Walzer observes, is never explicitly defended in the Bible; indeed, it couldn&#x2019;t be defended since God&#x2019;s word had to be as singular as God himself. Yet different political regimes are described in the biblical texts, and there are conflicting political arguments&#x2014;and also a recurrent anti-political argument: if you have faith in God, you have no need for strong institutions, prudent leaders, or reformist policies. At the same time, however, in the books of law and prophecy, the people of Israel are called upon to overcome oppression and &#x201c;let justice well up like water, righteousness like an unfailing stream.&#x201d;</p></p><p><p>A Conversation with Michael Walzer</p><p>Q:&nbsp; Why did you write this book?</p><p>A:&nbsp; I think about politics all the time when I read, and I've been reading the Bible all my life. So why should this book be different from any other book?&nbsp;There is a politics in the Bible, and sometimes an anti-politics, and the stories and arguments are gripping. They cry out for our engagement.</p><p>Q:&nbsp; What did you find most surprising in the Bible?</p><p>A:&nbsp; The many voices, the radical pluralism of the Bible, which is really an anthology, a book of books. The last editors&nbsp;would never have called themselves pluralists or articulated a doctrine of pluralism, but they were remarkably inclusive. They brought together radically contradictory views, without seeking to harmonize the contradictions.</p><p>Q:&nbsp; So, is there a biblical political doctrine, a single teaching, a lesson to be learned?</p><p>A:&nbsp; No. Biblical fundamentalists will have a hard time finding&nbsp;the foundations. There is a biblical doctrine about religion and one about justice, but there is radical disagreement among the Bible's authors about politics. Some&nbsp;are actively hostile: when God is king, what need is there for human politics?</p><p>Praise for Michael Walzer&#x2019;s <i>Arguing about War</i>:</p><p>&#x201c;Walzer has moved the concerns over just war from the periphery of political theory to the very center of our democratic dilemma.&#x201d;&#x2014;Garry Wills, <i>New York</i><i> Review of Books</i></p><p>Praise for Michael Walzer&#x2019;s <i>On Toleration</i>:</p><p>"The genius of Walzer's little book . . . is how realistic it is about the contradictions confronting those who would create an open society."&#x2014;E.

Yet an increasing number of young men today say that those categories are too rigid. They are, they insist, &#x201c;mostly straight.&#x201d; They&#x2019;re straight, but they feel a slight but enduring romantic or sexual desire for men. To the uninitiated, this may not make sense. How can a man be &#x201c;mostly&#x201d; straight? Ritch Savin-Williams introduces us to this new world by bringing us the stories of young men who consider themselves to be mostly straight or sexually fluid. By hearing about their lives, we discover a radically new way of understanding sexual and romantic development that upends what we thought we knew about men.</p><p>Today there are more mostly straight young men than there are gay and bisexual young men combined. Based on cutting-edge research, Savin-Williams explores the personal stories of forty young men to help us understand the biological and psychological factors that led them to become mostly straight and the cultural forces that are loosening the sexual bind that many boys and young men experience. These young men tell us how their lives have been influenced by their &#x201c;drop of gayness,&#x201d; from their earliest sexual memories and crushes to their sexual behavior as teenagers and their relationships as young adults. <i>Mostly Straight</i> shows us how these young men are forging a new personal identity that confounds both traditional ideas and conventional scientific opinion.</p></p><p>Ritch C. Savin-Williams is Professor Emeritus in the Department of Human Development at Cornell University.&#x201c;An illuminating new study about male sexual fluidity...Calling for a more modern understanding of sexual orientation, [Savin-Williams&#x2019;s] idea is that increasing numbers of millennial metrosexual young men are shunning rigid notions of sexuality, and increasingly not identifying as straight, but mostly straight. These are not closeted gay or bisexual men but a new generation of guys who are predominantly heterosexual but have embraced the idea that sexuality exists on a spectrum and who have less anxiety than previous generations about being open to intimacy with other guys.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Uli Lenart</b><b>, </b><b><i>Attitude</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Savin-Williams, a highly respected psychologist and pioneer in research on sexual minority youth, brings us a fascinating and in-depth exploration of nonexclusive heterosexuality among young men. Woven around engaging first person narratives that defy gender stereotypes, and supported by emerging science on male sexual fluidity, <i>Mostly Straight</i> offers an opportunity to challenge the status quo of tripartite sexual identities and attractions&#x2015;bi, gay, straight&#x2015;and consider the possibility of a more flexible, and less categorical, sexuality.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Meredith Chivers, Associate Professor of Psychology and Director of the Sexuality and Gender Laboratory (SageLab), Queen&#x2019;s University</b><br><br>&#x201c;This is a book whose time has come, and there is no one better suited to tell these riveting, surprising stories than Ritch Savin-Williams. For too long, men who consider themselves &#x2018;mostly straight&#x2019; have been invisible and misunderstood. Their experiences will challenge your assumptions about sexual identity and orientation and reveal blind spots in your thinking that you didn&#x2019;t know you had.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Lisa Diamond, author of <i>Sexual Fluidity</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;In this beautifully written book, Savin-Williams offers a nuanced and substantive portrait of an often overlooked group.

Their correspondence contains the only known extant philosophical writings by Elisabeth, revealing her mastery of metaphysics, analytic geometry, and moral philosophy, as well as her keen interest in natural philosophy. The letters are essential reading for anyone interested in Descartes&#x2019;s philosophy, in particular his account of the human being as a union of mind and body, as well as his ethics.

Nine years after the death of Catarina de San Juan, the Inquisition banned copies of her image and biography, fearing that a cult was forming around this popular holy woman in Puebla, New Spain. Inquisitors enlisted the assistance of Mari Sï¿½nchez's daughter to prove that this Jewish converso was guilty of practicing Judaism in secret, an accusation that led to her death.

Examining the stories of fifteen women in the context of this fearful Catholic institution in both Spain and the New World, the contributors chronicle a broad range of "crimes" against the Catholic Church, including sexual transgressions, the practice of crypto-Judaism, and the writing and preaching by alumbradas that undermined Catholic orthodoxy.

From this point on, O&#x2019;Neill&#x2019;s work falls roughly into three phases: the early plays, written from 1914 to 1921 (<i>The Long Voyage Home</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Moon of the Caribbees</i>,&nbsp;<i>Beyond the Horizon</i>,&nbsp;<i>Anna Christie</i>); a variety of full-length plays for Broadway (<i>Desire Under the Elms</i>,&nbsp;<i>Great God Brown</i>,&nbsp;<i>Ah, Wilderness!</i>); and the last, great plays, written between 1938 and his death (<i>The Iceman Cometh</i>,&nbsp;<i>A Moon for the Misbegotten</i>). O'Neill&nbsp;is a four-time Pulitzer Prize winner, and he was awarded the Nobel Prize in literature in 1936.</p><h2>The Napoleon of Notting Hill</h2><p>Auberon Quin, who loves jokes, is chosen to be king of England.</p><p>For those of the Catholic faith who enjoy reading the Catholic classics and wonderful Catholic books that are hard to find in other places, you&#39;ll find yourself enthusiastic with Catholic Way Publishing, who exist to supply you with these glorious works.

In this thought-provoking book, Polkinghorne focuses on the collegiality between science and theology, contending that the inquiries of these "intellectual cousins" are parallel.<br>"Polkinghorne [presents] a polished and logically coherent argument."&#x2014;Freeman J. Dyson, <i>New York Review of Books<br></i>"Short, accessible, and authoritative."&#x2014;Carlin Romano, <i>Philadelphia Inquirer<br></i>"This book should be widely read."&#x2014;Colin Tudge, <i>New Statesman and Society<br></i>"If you read one book on science and religion, this should be it."&#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p></p><p><i>Belief in God in an Age of Science</i>, by the renowned theoretical physicist and theologian John Polkinghorne (a fellow of Queen's College, Cambridge), collects a series of lectures exploring the compatibility of science and theology. Polkinghorne's most interesting argument is that the two disciplines, which he calls "intellectual cousins," exhibit "a common concern with the attainment of understanding through the search for motivated belief." He describes this common concern by comparing the scientific investigation into the nature of light that led to the quantum theory with the theological investigation of the nature of Christ's being that led to the Chalcedonian Creed. Polkinghorne's prose is lucid throughout, and his broadminded rigor persuades readers that "if reality is generously and adequately construed, then knowledge will be seen to be one; if rationality is generously and adequately construed, then science and theology will be seen as partners in a common quest for understanding." <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>Selected by Publishers Weekly as one of the Best Books in Religion of 1998 <p>Selected by Booklist as one of the Top Ten Books in Religion in 1998</p></p><h2>Undue Risk: Secret State Experiments on Humans</h2><p>In 1994, Jonathan Moreno became a senior staff member of a special commission created by President Clinton to investigate allegations of government-sponsored radiation research on unknowing citizens during the cold war.

By this letter, we intend to correct the record by retracting passages in the book which suggested</p><p> (1) that you had engaged, during your service as a physician in the South African Defense Forces (SADF) in the 1980s, in experiments with biological agents so unethical and morally culpable as to justify investigation for possible prosecution in the International Court of Justice, and</p><p> (2) that your position with the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons had placed you &#x201c;beyond the reach&#x201d; of the investigatory power of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (&#x201c;TRC&#x201d;) established by the Mandela government of South Africa.</p><p> We now unequivocally withdraw and retract all statements, implications and suggestions made by the passages concerning you at pages 295 to 296 in the first printing of &#x201c;Undue Risk&#x201d;. Based on evidence you have provided to us, we accept that you cooperated voluntarily and extensively with investigators of the TRC, provided valuable information to them, were prepared to go to South Africa to testify at the trials of others at the request of prosecuting authorities, and that neither the TRC nor South African prosecutors, after investigation, found any basis for any charges against you.</p><p> We apologize to you for the inclusion of such passages in the book which was distributed in the United States and internationally as a hard cover book. We also regret and apologize for the fact that these false passages were also published on the Freeman website. As you know, the entire text of the passages referring to you has been and will continue to be removed from all subsequent printings, including any soft cover edition.</p><p> You are free to use this letter in any manner, in any context or circumstance where you deem it necessary to refute any statement or implication by anyone based on the erroneous first printing of &#x201c;Undue Risk&#x201d;. The undersigned, or other spokespersons for Freeman will be pleased to authenticate this letter should any third party to whom it is shown wish to inquire as to its authenticity.</p><p> Very truly yours,</p><p> W.

Moreno<br></p>Unethical experimentation will always be with us, Dr. Moreno wrote, but if secrecy is limited and good model experimental programs can be developed, the abuses may be limited.<br>--Philip J. Hilts, <i>New York Times</i><br><br>In 1994, Jonathan Moreno became a senior staff member of a special commission created by President Clinton to investigate allegations of government-sponsored radiation research on unknowing citizens during the cold war. The top secret documents he helped to declassify revealed a shocking truth-- that human experimentation played an extensive role in this country's attempts to build and protect against weapons of mass destruction.<br><br>In <i>Undue Risk</i>, Moreno presents the first comprehensive history of the use of human subjects in atomic, biological, and chemical warfare experiments from World War II to the twenty-first century. From the courtrooms of Nuremberg to the battlefields of the Gulf War, <i>Undue Risk</i> explores a variety of government policies and specific cases, including plutonium injections into unwitting hospital patients, U.S. government attempts to recruit Nazi medical scientists, the subjection of soldiers to atomic blast fallout, secret LSD and mescaline studies, and the feeding of irradiated oatmeal to children. It is also the first book to go behind the scenes and reveal the government's struggle with the ethics of human experimentation and the evolution of agonizing policy choices on unfamiliar moral terrain.<br><br>As the threat of foreign and domestic terrorist attack continues to grow, the need for our country to defend itself against insidious weapons is greater than ever. Can a democracy justify using humans in potentially risky experiments in order to answer scientific questions vital to national security? Exploring the possibilities, <i>Undue Risk</i> highlights a program of human experimentation that is a moral model for all others, civilian and military.<br><br>JONATHAN MORENO, a former senior staff member of President Clinton's Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments, is Kornfeld Professor of Biomedical Ethics and Director of the Center for Biomedical Ethics at the University if Virginia.

Born in 1929 in a Tibetan village, Tsering developed a strong dislike of his country&#39;s theocratic ruling elite. As a 13-year-old member of the Dalai Lama&#39;s personal dance troupe, he was frequently whipped or beaten by teachers for minor infractions. A heterosexual, he escaped by becoming a drombo, or homosexual passive partner and sex-toy, for a well-connected monk. After studying at the University of Washington, he returned to Chinese-occupied Tibet in 1964, convinced that Tibet could become a modernized society based on socialist, egalitarian principles only through cooperation with the Chinese. Denounced as a &#39;counterrevolutionary&#39; during Mao&#39;s Cultural Revolution, he was arrested in 1967 and spent six years in prison or doing forced labor in China. Officially exonerated in 1978, Tsering became a professor of English at Tibet University in Lhasa. He now raises funds to build schools in Tibet&#39;s villages, emphasizing Tibetan language and culture.</p><p>The considerable value of Tashi's briskly told life story is that it complicates our view of modern Tibet. Born in a Tibetan village in 1929, Tashi wrested the opportunity to study in India and the United States before returning to China in 1964 against the advice of his friends. A freethinking liberal and patriot, he mistrusted the Tibetan government-in-exile and naively viewed the Chinese occupation as an opportunity to modernize his tradition-bound homeland. But he was imprisoned during the Cultural Revolution and prevented from returning to Tibet until 1981, when he finally got a university job teaching English. His is a harrowing but remarkably unbitter story with a happy ending for him, if not for Tibet. Recommended for academic and larger public libraries.?Steven I.

Whether depicting parents and offspring being sacrificed for selfish gains, or imbeciles sacrificing their own individuality on a literary whim, these tales all draw sustenance from an underlying belief: the root of religion is crime against man, nature and God, and that in this hell on earth, even the worst among us has a soul.<br><br>A close friend to Joris-Karl Huysmans, and later admired by the likes of Kafka and Borges, <b>Lï¿½on Bloy</b> (1846&#x2013;1917) is among the best known but least translated of the French Decadent writers. Nourishing antireligious sentiments in his youth, his outlook changed radically when he moved to Paris and came under the influence of Barbey d'Aurevilly, the unconventionally religious novelist best known for <i>Les Diaboliques</i>. He earned the dual nicknames of "The Pilgrim of the Absolute" through his unorthodox devotion to the Catholic Church, and "The Ungrateful Beggar" through his endless reliance on the charity of friends to support him and his family.</p><p>Perhaps his most explicit selection of harangues and exhortations, the newly reissued Disagreeable Tales (Histoires dï¿½sobligeantes, 1894) represents a unique literary genre&#x2015;inspired by Villiers de L&#x2019;Isle-Adam&#x2019;s Cruel Tales (1883), Barbey d&#x2019;Aurevilly&#x2019;s Les diaboliques (1874) and the short sketches of Poe and Lautrï¿½amont.

Although existing books begin with advanced concepts, such as emptiness or egolessness, <i>The Positive Psychology of Buddhism and Yoga</i> begins with very basic concepts and avoids the exotic and so called "mystical" notions. Levine emphasizes the goals of Buddhism and Yoga and the methods they employ to achieve those goals. <br> <br> This book is divided into four sections. The first deals with Buddhism, the second with Yoga, and the third describes aims and practices in Western clinical psychology. The fourth section is a workshop on handling anger. The central lesson of the first three sections is that one can improve one's life by changing one's self. This fourth section applies this lesson and the methods of the three preceding sections to handling one's own anger. Overall the book is rich with Eastern tales and illustrative anecdotes. These concrete examples vividly illuminate the general conceptual presentation.<br> <br> Levine shows not only the basic concerns of Buddhism and Yoga and how intensely practical their methods are but how these concerns and methods relate to those of modern Western psychology. Application to daily living is emphasized throughout.<br> <br> The serious reader should start:<br> *to experience less anger, agitation, and stress;<br> *to improve relationships with coworkers, family, and friends; and<br> *to face life's challenges with greater wisdom and strength.<br></p><p><p>Marvin Levine, a well-known researcher and theorist in cognitive-experimental psychology, received his M.A. at Harvard where he worked with B.F. Skinner and George Miller, and his Ph.D. with Harry Harlow at the University of Wisconsin. Since 1965 he has been a professor in the Department of Psychology at Stony Brook University.</p> <p></p> <p>His earliest work was on intellectual problem solving, research that served to counter the then popular conditioning view of human behavior. He later turned his attention to interpersonal problem solving, giving workshops on assertiveness training and anger management, and for several years helped resolve disputes as a volunteer mediator. He is also a published poet and a professional musician. As is revealed in this volume, all these activities have contributed to his understanding of human nature.</p> <p></p> <p>He also maintained a long-standing interest in Eastern philosophy. He gradually began to see similarities between the conceptions and methods of Buddhism and Yoga and those of Western psychotherapy. In this accessible book he discusses these three systems. The exotic and "mystical" trappings from Buddhism and Yoga are stripped away. The emphasis, instead, is on their aims and methods, and their relation to Western psychology. This approach provides a clear understanding of how to live a more useful, happier life. It is also an essential read for anyone interested in an enlarged framework for modern psychology. </p><p><i>There are few books that can make a real difference in people's lives--this is one of them....Levine's <b>The Positive Psychology of Buddhism and Yoga</b> is an intellectual tour-de-force. It is a 'must read' for any psychologist interested in Eastern thought. Many hundreds of millions of people believe that Enlightenment is the ultimate goal in life. Levine's new book could be the best first step toward becoming Enlightened that any of us will take. This work has the potential to become THE book that people (like me) recommend to many readers as a way to understand Eastern perspectives.</i><br>&#x2014;<b>George Howard, Ph.D.</b><br><i>University of Notre Dame</i></p><p><i>Marvin Levine tells a profound story in a style that engages while it informs us of new ways to view the world within ourselves and without....This book teaches us vital lessons about how these Eastern philosophical traditions can be integrated with Western psychological methods of understanding the mind...I think it has as much value to novices as well as to professionals in these areas.

Ranging from the films of Ross McElwee (<em>Bright Leaves</em>) and Agnï¿½s Varda (<em>The Gleaners and I</em>) to those of Abbas Kiarostami (<em>Close Up</em>) and Ari Folman (<em>Waltz with Bashir</em>), such films have intrigued viewers who at the same time have struggled to categorize them. Sometimes described as personal documentaries or diary films, these eclectic works are, rather, best understood as cinematic variations on the essay. So argues Tim Corrigan in this stimulating and necessary new book. Since Michel de Montaigne, essays have been seen as a lively literary category, and yet--despite the work of pioneers like Chris Marker--seldom discussed as a cinematic tradition. <em>The Essay Film</em>, offering a thoughtful account of the long rapport between literature and film as well as novel interpretations and theoretical models, provides the ideas that will change this.<br></p><p><br><strong>Timothy Corrigan</strong> is Professor of Cinema Studies, English, and History of Art at the University of Pennsylvania. He is the author of <em>New German Film</em> and <em>A Cinema without Walls</em> and an editor of <em>Critical Visions in Film Theory</em>.<br><br>"The editors have similarly assembled a diverse and interdisciplinary group of renowned authors and practitioners, focusing here on the essay film's heterogeneous forms and practices. As such, this volume is a welcome addition to a growing body of literature that investigates the place of subjectivity and "the personal" within documentary filmmaking. It should also be of interest to a range of humanities students and scholars, together with nonfiction and experimental filmmakers." -- Tanya Goldman, <em>Cinema Journal</em><p></p><br>"<em>The Essay Film</em> is the most compelling and spirited monograph to surface yet on the topic."--Rick Warner, <em>Critical Quarterly</em><p></p><br>"For media artists, scholars and students of cinema, Corrigan's reflections offer a passionate and convincing testimony to the transformative power of the essay film. Not since I read Roland Barthes' <em>Mythologies</em> have I come across a book that provides such a strong articulation of the visual thinking process."--Lynne Sachs, filmmaker<p></p><br>"Timothy Corrigan writes persuasively and vividly in offering up this coherent overview of the sprawling international phenomenon of the essay film. By providing a concise historical context, which ranges from Michel Montaigne to Michael Moore, he allows us to see the continuum and value of this idiosyncratic and vital form of expression."--Ross McElwee, Director, <em>Sherman's March</em><p></p><br>"Inventively and insightfully, Timothy Corrigan establishes the essay film as a cinematic form of 'thinking out loud.' His eloquent book provides something similar: it is a richly productive meditation on meanings that interweaves voices, subjectivities, and resonant reflection. This essential volume now determines future consideration of this key genre."--Dana Polan, author of <em>Scenes of Instruction: The Beginnings of the U.S. Study of Film</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Applied Cryptography: Protocols, Algorithms, and Source Code in C</h2><p>". . .the best introduction to cryptography I've ever seen. . . .

Not merely replacing male pronouns, the translators have rethought what kind of language has built barriers between the text and its readers. Seeking to be faithful to the original Greek, they have sought new and non-sexist ways to express the same ancient truths. <i>The Inclusive New Testament</i> is a fresh, dynamic translation into modern English, carefully crafted to let the power and poetry of the language shine forth-particularly when read aloud-giving it an immediacy and intimacy rarely found in translations of the Bible.<br><br>The <i>Inclusive New Testament</i> is also available together with <i>The Inclusive Psalms</i> or as a part of <i>The Inclusive Bible</i>.</p><p><b>Priests for Equality</b> is a movement of women and men throughout the world&#x2015;laity, religious and clergy&#x2015;who work for the full participation of women and men in church and society.

Created with a deep respect for, and scholarly reliance on, original Hebrew and Greek texts, this translation transcends a mere substitution of pronouns and avoids hewing to any politically correct line.

It is intended to provide liturgical and devotional expression for those persons who yearn for for a church that allows for a full expression of their contemporary spiritual struggles and changing social roles.Created with a deep respect for, and scholarly reliance on, original Hebrew and Greek texts, this translation transcends a mere substitution of pronouns and avoids hewing to any "politically correct" line. Rather, the Inclusive New Testament seeks to open the language of Scripture to interpretation and reflection by those persons, be they women or men, who wish to explore the ways the Testament can guide and inform their spiritual development or renew their faith.

How do you use it? Do you say &#34;These candies are for him and me&#34; -- or &#34;he and I&#34;? In this addition to her acclaimed language series, using rhythmic verse and stunningly rich illustrations, Ruth Heller shows young readers how playful language can really be.After receiving a fine arts degree from the University of California at Berkeley and completing two years of graduate work in design at the California College of Arts and Crafts in Oakland, <b>Ruth Heller</b> (1923-2004) began her career designing wrapping paper, cocktail napkins, greeting cards, and coloring books. After five years of rejection and one complete revision, Heller's first book,&nbsp;<i>Chickens Aren't the Only Ones</i>, about egg-laying animals, was published in 1981. It was so successful that the sequel, and second book to be published,&nbsp;<i>Animals Born Alive And Well</i>&nbsp;(1982), about mammals, quickly followed. In 1983 and 1984, her third and fourth titles,&nbsp;<i>The Reason For A Flower</i>&nbsp;(about plants that have seeds and flowers) and&nbsp;<i>Plants That Never Ever Bloom</i>&nbsp;(about plants that do not) were published.<br> <br> She then began work on a collection of six books, the&nbsp;<i>How To Hide</i>&nbsp;series on camouflage and the magic of this phenomenon in nature, which covered the entire animal kingdom -- insects, birds, mammals, amphibians, reptiles, and sea creatures. The next collection of books became a five-volume series on parts of speech:&nbsp;<i>A Cache of Jewels and Other Collective Nouns; Kites Sail High: A Book About Verbs; Many Luscious Lollipops: A Book About Adjectives; Merry-Go-Round: A Book About Nouns;</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Up, Up and Away: A Book About Adverbs</i>. She also wrote and illustrated the unique and fascinating book&nbsp;<i>Color</i>, a charming and instructive guide to how art goes through the four color printing process.<br> <br> Among the notable people who have had an influence on Heller's writing have been: Ogden Nash, Gilbert and Sullivan, Edward Lear, Hilaire Belloc, and Dr. Seuss. Heller says of her work, "All my books are nonfiction picture books in rhyme. I find writing in rhyme enjoyable and challenging, and I think it is an easy way for children to learn new facts and acquire a sophisticated vocabulary. Children are not intimidated by big words. I try to make my writing succinct and allow the illustrations to convey as much information as possible."</p><h2>The Double: New Translation (Evergreens)</h2><p><p>Constantly rebuffed from the social circles he aspires to frequent, the timid clerk Golyadkin is confronted by the sudden appearance of his double, a more brazen, confident and socially successful version of himself, who abuses and victimizes the original.

They are extremely important as basic equations in many areas of mathematical physics, and they have received renewed attention because of progress in their solution by machines.<br>This volume undertakes a definition of the field, indicating advances that have been made up through 1960. The author's position is that while the advent of machines has resulted in much new knowledge, one should not disregard analytical methods, since the solution of nonlinear equations possesses singularities which only the analytical method (as based upon the work of Poincare, Liapounoff, Painleve and Goursatl can discover.<br>After a general survey of the problem presented by nonlinear equations, the author discusses the differential equation of the first order, following this by chapters on the Riccati equation (as a bridge between linear and nonlinear equations) and existence theorems, with special reference to Cauchy's method. Second order equations are introduced via Volterra's problem and the problem of pursuit, and succeeding chapters cover elliptic integrals and functions and theta functions; differential equations of the second order; and second order differential equations of the polynomial class, with special reference to Painleve transcendents. The technique of continuous analytical continuation is shown, while phenomena of the phase plane are studied as an introduction to nonlinear mechanics. Nonlinear 111echanics is then discussed, with various classical equations like Van der Pol's equations, Emden's equation, and the Duffing problem. The remaining chapters are concerned with nonlinear integral equations, problems from the calculus of variations, and numerical integration of nonlinear equations. Throughout the book the results of distinguished analysis of the past and modern machine computations are both taken into account. Despite the thoroughness of its coverage this is a very fine introduction to this important area of mathematics, and it can easily be followed by the mathematically sophisticated reader who knows very little about nonlinear equations.</p><p></p></p><p></p><h2>Bioorganic Chemistry: Peptides and Proteins (Topics in Bioorganic and Biological Chemistry)</h2><p>Bioorganic chemistry has expanded rapidly over the past two decades, enriching the disciplines of biology and chemistry and providing important insights into the workings of biological systems at a molecular level. Recently, this growing field has witnessed some very exciting results in applying design and synthesis techniques to many problems in molecular biology. Bridging the gap between chemistry and biology, <em>Topics in Bioorganic and Biological Chemistry: A Series of Books in Support of Teaching and Research</em> will serve the needs of the many graduate students and researchers who work in and study this discipline. <br> This second volume, <em>Bioorganic Chemistry: Peptides and Proteins</em>, provides a broad overview of the topic. It covers the chemical synthesis of peptides and proteins and modern methods for analysis of protein structure and folding, reviews the ways in which proteins function as catalysts, and compares enzymes with antibody catalysts. The text is comprised of 14 chapters, making it ideal for use in a one-semester, graduate level special topic course in peptides and proteins. <br> Each chapter begins with an introduction that includes basic principles, a summary of key findings which support current research in the field, and an overview of current research activity. The remainder of each chapter deals in greater detail with a number of recent studies that illustrate the nature of ongoing activity in the field. All chapters have been written by leading researchers, and numerous references are given. <em>Topics in Bioorganic and Biological Chemistry</em> is the first series specifically designed to facilitate the education of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. The first three volumes in the series, <em>Bioorganic Chemistry: Nucleic Acids, Peptides and Proteins</em>, and <em>Carbohydrates</em>, will also prove helpful to research workers who wish to gain familiarity with specific research topics.<br></p><p>Sidney M.

In this new edition, Wilson adds an afterword to her original award-winning photographic essay, published in 1989 when Watt Matthews was ninety years old and the vital force behind a vast West Texas ranch. Watt was the ninth and last child of pioneering parents who had established the ranch on the banks of the Clear Fork of the Brazos in 1858, and, in the words of historian David McCullough, "created a family kingdom so large and still so true to its traditional way of life that visitors sometimes have to remind themselves that it is all real." Except for four years at Princeton, Watt spent his entire life on the ranch, which had remained its own separate world into the late twentieth century. Those days are beautifully chronicled in Wilson's photographs and, in this new edition, she brings the story of Lambshead Ranch up to the present by writing of Watt's funeral and what has happened to the ranch since Watt's death in 1997.</p><p></p><h2>La Vendee 1/2e (Oxford World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>Set in rural France in 1793 and centering on the civil war between royalists and rebel republicans, this is Trollope&#39;s only historical novel.

The subversive themes that run beneath the surface of the narrative are treated fully in the introduction, which also sheds light on how this book constituted Trollope&#39;s own rebellion against his family.

Sifting through dozens of their daughter's remarkable sketchbooks, our generation's most celebrated graphic artists have, with their only child, Sophie, now selected more than three hundred paintings and drawings that depict her artistic and psychological maturation. Revealing how an original artistic sensibility is both innate and nurtured, the book features six separate developmental stages, including Sophie's earliest drawings, the elaborate fantasy world of her childhood, her late adolescent rebellion, and her coming of age in the milieu of the Paris circus world and New York's "seventh circle of hell." The drawings from her early twenties&#x2015;of tattoo artists, dangerous men&#x2015;reflect a personal anguish that finally ends with her becoming a mother and creating a family of her own. Illuminating and intimate, this book is a dramatic yet subtle statement on the evolution of personality as seen through art. Four-color illustrations throughout</p><p><p><strong>Sophie Crumb</strong> has collaborated with her parents on <em>Dirty Laundry Comics</em> and has produced her own series, <em>Bellybutton Comix</em>.

His books include&nbsp;<em>The Book of Genesis Illustrated by R. Crumb</em>, and many more. He lives in the south of France with his wife, the artist Aline Kominsky-Crumb.</p>Sophie Crumb's slender body of published comics so far identifies her as an interesting--but still mostly promising--young cartoonist. Questions about this compilation of childhood and sketchbook drawings are both unavoidable and acknowledged. In their twin introductions, Sophie's parents (and co-editors) Robert and Aline Kominsky-Crumb position this book as something other than "Crumbsploitation," praising their daughter's artwork and suggesting that this chronological, lifelong sketchbook anthology constitutes a unique and fascinating document of personal and artistic development. The book satisfies somewhat on these counts. Sophie's earliest work includes very advanced preschool art, and she remains continuously prolific. However, to distance this work from her family background denies part of the reason for her early, sustained development and one of this book's major narrative threads: her relationship to the legacy of her celebrated parents. Their presence as media guides is evident in her early subjects (the Three Stooges, vintage cartoons). Later she leaves home to join a circus, study tattooing, and live with lowlifes in New York City. The true legacy of her parents' influence is her constant outpouring of uncensored, self-critical, and perceptive drawing. (Nov.)

The book is divided into two main sections: <i>guiding principles</i>, which anchor community psychologists to a coherent set of fundamental values, and <i>orienting concepts</i>, that allow us to remain open to paradigm-shaking perspectives. It explores the past, present, and future of community psychology, balancing reviews of classic work, descriptions of the current state of the field, and emerging perspectives. Not intended as a definitive attempt to cover the field, but as an invitation to readers to discover the field and make it their own, the book draws readers into a dialogue about community psychology that continues after the last word of the book is read. <b> </b> Community Psychology: Where It Came From and What It Is; Community Psychologists: Who We Are and What We Do; The Importance of Values; Beyond the Individual Level; Appreciating Diversity; Embracing Social Change; Strengths Perspective; Stress and Coping; Prevention; Empowerment; Resilience; Community Psychology in the 21 Century. </p></p><p><p> This new text provides a clear and compelling organization that conveys the unique perspective of community psychology. Written in an engaging style, and including photos, cartoons, and graphics, the text promotes students' enthusiasm and interest in creating change. </p><p> Writing a textbook in community psychology requires the resolution of two challenges. First, community psychology consists of a way of thinking more than a set of accumulated facts. Second, the field's values inform action as much as basic research and theory. Textbooks traditionally focus on received knowledge&#x2014;the stable, time-tested, agreed-upon "facts" of a field. This cannot be done for community psychology, at least not in the same way. A hallmark of community psychology is the view of understanding as contextual. Knowledge develops within a sociocultural and historical setting, and science is not pure, objective, and value-free. Moreover, the goal of community psychology is not solely to increase understanding but to use our knowledge to create a more just and humane society. Community psychology's existence as a way of thinking and acting rather than a body of facts helps explain why there have been a dearth of textbooks, but it also makes the field immensely exciting. </p> <p><b>Guiding Principles and Orienting Concepts as the Organizational Schemes</b></p> <p> The organizing scheme of this textbook makes. clear community psychology's unique approach. The book is divided into two main sections: <i>guiding principles,</i> which anchor community psychologists to a coherent set of fundamental values, and <i>orienting concepts,</i> that allow us to remain open to paradigm-shaking perspectives. </p> <p> Throughout the years, community psychologists have delineated a set of principles that define our way of thinking. These principles differentiate community psychology from other areas of psychology. They give the field its singular character, instill a sense of identity and pride in its practitioners and permit the field to exist as a stable and circumscribed entity. </p> <p> Two introductory chapters ground the inquiry into community psychology. The first describes where community psychology came from and what it is. The second describes who community psychologists are and what we do. The next section consists of five chapters, each of which examines one of community psychology's guiding principle. The five principles are: </p> <ul> <li>A view of knowledge as fluid and value based;</li> <li>The belief that one cannot understand an individual without also understanding the many-leveled social contexts in which that individual lives;</li> <li>Attention to the voices of diverse (and often disenfranchised) groups;</li> <li>A commitment to improving the lives of individuals through intervention and social change;</li> <li>An emphasis on a strengths model rather than deficit model of mental health.</li> </ul> <p> While the guiding principles are the stable foundation on which the practice and research of community psychology build, orienting concepts allow the field to remain relevant in a changing world. Orienting concepts are frameworks that summarize past research and theory, give meaning to current knowledge, and guide future research and action. They put the guiding principles into action. Orienting concepts, unlike fundamental principles, are supposed to change. As our knowledge grows and Zeitgeists shift, so too do our orienting concepts. The field needs new orienting concepts to inspire new insights, bring new energy, and shake us out of our collective intellectual complacency Without new orienting concepts, community psychology's research and practice would become "one-sided" (Rappaport, 1981, p. Z1). </p> <p> The third section of this book describes the field's orienting concepts. Four chapters examine each orienting concept, thereby providing a review and application of the guiding principles, and a chronological overview of the development of the field. The orienting concepts are: </p> <ul> <li>Stress and coping</li> <li>Prevention</li> <li>Empowerment</li> <li>Resilience</li> </ul> <p> In keeping with community psychology's emphasis on the <i>context</i> of knowledge, each chapter begins with a description of the surrounding culture from which the chapter's ideas emerged and ends with a forward-looking section entitled <i>The Promise of Community Psychology.</i> In this section I examine an idea from the chapter that has captured my own imagination and may have implications for future community psychology. Thus, I have tried to attend to the past, present, and future of community psychology, balancing reviews of classic work, descriptions of the current state of the field, and emerging perspectives. </p> <p> Textbooks frequently present information as definitive, objective summaries of a field. My goal however, is not to line up silent and obedient facts that students can march-into examination booklets. I hope readers feel invited into a dialogue about community psychology that continues after the last word of this text is read. Toward this goal, I have provided numerous references as resources for future inquiries. </p> <p> Community psychology recognizes that researchers and practitioners are not disengaged observers of life, but active participants whose own beliefs and experiences influence their work. One goal of the field has been to resist the temptation to present scientific endeavors as value-free and to be candid instead about the viewpoints that inform our own understanding. In keeping with this perspective, I have adopted a personal approach to the material and relate how my experiences have influenced my thinking about community psychology. At the same time, I realize the limitations of one person's perspective (limitations that I expect will be even more apparent to readers), but I hope that my perspective provides a helpful window to the material and encourages readers to bring themselves and their varied experiences to the table as well. This book is not intended as a definitive attempt to cover the field, but as an invitation to students to discover the field and make it their own. </p><p> </p><p><b>Action Orientation</b></p> <p> Community psychology views knowledge as constructed and therefore focuses on ways of thinking rather than facts per se. Learning to think like a community psychologist is <i>not,</i> however, an end goal. Community psychology succeeds as a field only to the extent that its unique ways of thinking promote useful ways of acting in the world. The study of community psychology should result in a raised consciousness about the sorts of problems that require intervention and an increased awareness of how to intervene effectively. </p><p> Community psychology's emphasis on the practical application of knowledge is at odds with the traditional view of academia. Webster's Dictionary offers the following among its definitions of <i>academic:</i> "theoretical without having an immediate or practical bearing... having no practical or useful significance." This view is not compatible with community psychology. Kurt Lewin, a forefather of the field, held that generating a knowledge base and effecting social change were two equally important and highly compatible goals of community research. Similarly, teaching in community psychology can and should be socially useful as well as theoretically meaningful. Thus, the textbook encourages informed student involvement in their communities. </p> <p> Students interested in community psychology have likely been attracted to the field because they have a good dose of inspiration to start with, believe that change is possible, and want to make a difference. This book succeeds if it fuels rather than stifles student creativity and activism. Photographs, cartoons, and other pedagogical devices are included to further engage the imagination. The dual interest in academics and action is also reinforced through the inclusion of Classic Research and Community Intervention boxes. The Classic Research boxes describe influential studies relevant to the chapter topic, sometimes in areas other than community psychology. The Community Intervention boxes show how the field's principles have been put into action by community psychologists and by others. (Admittedly, in a field that combines research and action, the distinction between research and intervention sometimes blurs.) </p> <p> Encouragement of student action permeates the text and becomes explicit at the end of each chapter in a section entitled Action Agenda. The activities in this section allow students to use information from the chapter as a basis for: (1) seeing themselves and their communities with new eyes; (2) generating ideas for needed changes; and (3) taking initial steps toward change. Certainly not all of these activities can be completed in the span of a semester, but hopefully they present some provocative ideas for living out community psychology in the process of studying it. Attention in this section to the dynamics of the classroom and the use of cooperative learning also allows students to explore ways of creating a community in the classroom as a microcosm of the larger society. </p> <p> In summary, this .textbook explores the past, present, and future of community psychology. The guiding principles and orienting concepts of the field constitute the main organizing structure. Readers are encouraged to think about the field, learn about themselves, and apply their knowledge to the world around them. </p></p><h2>Reading Luke: A Literary and Theological Commentary on the Third Gospel</h2><p>A readable study of Luke&#39;s Gospel for pastors, teachers and lay persons</p><p><b>Charles Talbert</b> is Distinguished Professor of Religion at Baylor University in Waco, Texas.

She was a hit in almost every branch of American show business--burlesque and vaudeville, drama and musical revues (including nine Ziegfeld follies) film and radio.Brice (1891-1951), best known as havoc-raising Baby Snooks to millions of radio fans in the last 14 years of her 40-year career, is portrayed in Grossman's entertaining, scrupulously documented study as an indefatigably versatile comedienne who owed her success to facility in adpating to new media; to her self-deprecating, often brash humor; to a superb mimetic gift; and to an ear for Yiddish and other dialects drawn from her New York ghetto and Coney Island childhood years. The author, board member of the American Repertory Theatre in Boston, contends that while legends--part fact, part fiction--of Brice's rise to fame from burlesque to Ziegfield Follies and Shubert and Belasco stardom were fostered both by her family and by Brice herself, it was talent and determination that won her a place as a major comic in a male-dominated field. However, neither talent, determination nor legend-building sufficed to fulfill Brice's dream of being recognized as a dramatic actress. Photos not seen by PW.

It not only shows them clearly how mathematics is directly applied to physics, but discusses math anxiety in general and how to overcome it. Instead of a rigorous development of the concepts of mathematics (as is found in a typical math book), the text describes the various mathematical concepts and tools (including algebra, trigonometry, geometry, vectors, and statistics) and their direct use in solving physics problems. Almost all sections end with worked-out examples and exercises directly from introductory physics. </p><p> This book is written for students who plan to take or who are presently taking an algebra-trigonometry-based physics course. The book will develop mathematical skill, provide the students with the competence to use mathematics, and serve as a mathematical resource. Students will find how mathematics is directly applied to physics. Students who have not recently taken a course that required mathematical skill often find themselves unable to keep pace in an introductory physics course because they are not familiar with the necessary mathematical tools. This book is written with these students in mind. Students taking other physics and science courses will also find the book useful. </p> <p> The book consists of seven chapters. Chapter 1 introduces students to physics and mathematics and discusses the role of mathematics in physics. It also discusses how to deal with the math anxiety that many students have, as well as how to develop good study habits. Chapter 2 describes scientific notation, units, and dimension of physical quantities. Chapters 3 through 7 describe the mathematical concepts and tools including algebra, geometry, trigonometry, vector, and statistics, with selected examples and real-world problems. Chapter 7 covers statistics and elaborates on the techniques of analyzing experimental data; it provides tips on how to be successful in a physics laboratory. </p> <p> The book emphasizes primarily the use of mathematical techniques and mathematical concepts in physics and does not go into their rigorous developments. Wherever possible, I have included examples and problems from physics so that students see how the concept of mathematics is directly applied to physics. The book is written so that students can study it to develop mathematical skills and can practice solving problems. There are worked-out examples and exercises in almost every section. The book can also be used as a text for a one-to two-credit course (dependent upon the depth of the coverage), a remedial mathematics course, or a physics recitation course for students taking an introductory physics course. Both the publisher and I realize the necessity of the book for introductory physics students. </p> <p> I would like to thank Dr. David Reid (East Michigan University), Dr. Ronald J. Bieniek (University of Missouri-Rolla), Dr. Anthony Pitucco (Pima Community College), Dr. Jenny Quan (Pasadena City College) and Dr. Dennis Rioux (University of WisconsinOshkosh) for their reviews and suggestions.

I would appreciate any constructive comments about the book. </p> <p><b>To the Students</b></p> <p> The primary purpose of this book is to develop mathematical skills that will allow you to concentrate on the physics in a physics course. You should find the book useful in other science courses that involve problem solving, and you can use the book as a mathematics resource book. The book is not meant to be a substitute for standard mathematics courses that may be prerequisites for an introductory physics course. The mathematics discussed is comparable to what you will find in a typical mathematics text. The emphasis is on enhancing those mathematical skills frequently used in a physics course. One objective of the book is to show you how the concepts of mathematics are directly applied and related to physics and real-world problems. </p> <p> For many of you, college level physics is different from most other courses. The emphasis is on understanding the physical concepts, deriving the physical laws or principles using mathematics, and applying this knowledge in solving a wide range of problems. There may be several obstacles to understanding physics and mastering problem solving. However, the primary factor that leads to success in physics and problem solving is the competence to use mathematics with ease and accuracy. My hope is that the book will make you stronger in mathematics so that your learning experience in physics will be beautiful and rewarding. The beauty of physics cannot be enjoyed if you are distracted and inhibited by a less-than-adequate mastery of basic mathematical skills. </p> <p> For your convenience, I have included important conversion factors, a list of fundamental constants, useful data, and other information in the appendices. I have used boxes throughout the book to draw your attention to important concepts or formulas. I have also used the boxes to inform you of students' common mistakes. </p> <p> Read Chapter 1 to learn about fun with physics and mathematics. Learn also how to develop good study habits and how to deal with math anxiety. Then begin Chapter 2.

Einstein famously rejected quantum mechanics, observing that God does not play dice. But, in fact, he thought more about the nature of atoms, molecules, and the emission and absorption of light&#x2015;the core of what we now know as quantum theory&#x2015;than he did about relativity.</p><p>A compelling blend of physics, biography, and the history of science, <i>Einstein and the Quantum</i> shares the untold story of how Einstein&#x2015;not Max Planck or Niels Bohr&#x2015;was the driving force behind early quantum theory. It paints a vivid portrait of the iconic physicist as he grappled with the apparently contradictory nature of the atomic world, in which its invisible constituents defy the categories of classical physics, behaving simultaneously as both particle and wave. And it demonstrates how Einstein's later work on the emission and absorption of light, and on atomic gases, led directly to Erwin Schrï¿½dinger's breakthrough to the modern form of quantum mechanics. The book sheds light on why Einstein ultimately renounced his own brilliant work on quantum theory, due to his deep belief in science as something objective and eternal.</p><p>A book unlike any other, <i>Einstein and the Quantum</i> offers a completely new perspective on the scientific achievements of the greatest intellect of the twentieth century, showing how Einstein's contributions to the development of quantum theory are more significant, perhaps, than even his legendary work on relativity.</p></p><p><p>"Common lore holds that Einstein's essential contribution to physics is relativity. But in this scholarly and accessible book, A. Douglas Stone argues convincingly that Einstein had a profound impact on the development of quantum theory. With lively, engaging, and thoroughly enjoyable prose, Stone's account is bound to be a definitive history of the subject, vividly establishing that Einstein's genius permeates one of the most startling advances in twentieth-century science."<b>--Brian Greene, author of <i>The Elegant Universe</i></b></p><p>"With his lucid and engaging style, A. Douglas Stone has captured one of the most interesting tales in the history of science. Despite Einstein's later discomfort with quantum theory, Stone shows how absolutely instrumental Einstein was in its development. It's a wonderful story that reveals the essence of Einstein's genius and creativity, and Stone is exactly the right person to tell it. I can hear Einstein chuckling in anticipation."<b>--Walter Isaacson, author of <i>Einstein: His Life and Universe</i> and <i>Steve Jobs</i></b></p><p>"A. Douglas Stone argues that the scientist best known as the creator of relativity theory was also the originator and substantial developer of almost every concept in the quantum mechanics that dominates today's physics. In this scholarly, convincing, and eloquently presented account, Einstein's personal and cultural lives are seamlessly interwoven with his science. I learned a great deal from <i>Einstein and the Quantum</i>, and recommend it to working physicists as well as students and nonscientists wishing to understand a central aspect of the cultural history of the twentieth century."<b>--Michael Berry, University of Bristol</b></p><p>"A. Douglas Stone, a physicist who has spent his life using quantum mechanics to explore striking new phenomena, has turned his considerable writing skills to thinking about Einstein and the quantum. What he finds and makes broadly understandable are the riches of Einstein's thinking not about relativity, not about his arguments with Bohr, but about Einstein's deep insights into the quantum world, insights that Stone shows speak to us now with all the vividness and depth they had a century ago. This is a fascinating book, lively, engaging, and strong in physical intuition."<b>--Peter Galison, author of <i>Einstein's Clocks, Poincarï¿½'s Maps</i></b></p><p>"Max Born said, 'Einstein is . . . clearly involved in the foundation of wave mechanics and no alibi can disprove it.'

This book provides a definitive view of these revivals, now known as the First Great Awakening, and their dramatic effects on American culture. Historian Thomas S. Kidd tells the absorbing story of early American evangelical Christianity through the lives of seminal figures like Jonathan Edwards and George Whitefield as well as many previously unknown preachers, prophets, and penitents.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Great Awakening helped create the evangelical movement, which heavily emphasized the individual&#x2019;s experience of salvation and the Holy Spirit&#x2019;s work in revivals. By giving many evangelicals radical notions of the spiritual equality of all people, the revivals helped breed the democratic style that would come to characterize the American republic. Kidd carefully separates the positions of moderate supporters of the revivals from those of radical supporters, and he delineates the objections of those who completely deplored the revivals and their wildly egalitarian consequences. The battles among these three camps, the author shows, transformed colonial America and ultimately defined the nature of the evangelical movement. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p>Thomas S. Kidd is associate professor of history, Baylor University, and author of <i>The Protestant Interest: New England after Puritanism</i>, published by Yale University Press. He lives in Woodway, TX.</p>"Well researched, clearly written and authoritatively argued. There is no book of comparable breadth, either chronologically or geographically."&#x2014;Mark Noll, University of Notre Dame<br><br> (Mark Noll)<br><br>&#x201c;It has been fifty years since Edwin Gaustad told the history of New England&#x2019;s Great Awakening, and, since then, the revivals themselves have at times been almost lost sight of in debates about the fictions of memory and the invention of tradition.&nbsp;Thomas Kidd&#x2019;s narrative, returning squarely to the formative events and factions that shaped early evangelicalism, offers a valuable synoptic account of the beginnings of this continuously important movement.&#x201d;&#x2014;Leigh E.

Gura)<br><br>&#x201c;With this deeply researched and beautifully focused study of the origins of American evangelicalism, Thomas Kidd gives us nothing less than a fresh, post-revisionist understanding of the Great Awakening. But that is not all. By casting a powerful light upon the controversies at the outset of the evangelical movement, particularly those revolving around the third person of the Trinity, he illuminates the rest of that movement&#x2019;s conflicted history, providing insight into its enduring complexities, and its likely manifestations in the century ahead.&#x201d;&#x2014;Wilfred McClay, author of <i>The Masterless: Self and Society in Modern America</i>&nbsp;<br> (Wilfred McClay)<br><br>&#x201c;Despite the prodigious attention to the &#x2018;Great Awakening&#x2019; in eighteenth-century America, there has been, amazingly, no modern comprehensive account that looks at all regions from Nova Scotia to Georgia.&nbsp;The result is a highly fragmented series of vignettes and biographies with no overarching narrative. That void has now been more than filled by Thomas Kidd's masterful analysis of the eighteenth-century revivals and the &#x2018;evangelical&#x2019; movement they spawned.&nbsp; Thoroughly researched and beautifully written, this book is must reading not only for early American historians, but for anyone concerned to understand the origins of modern evangelicalism.&#x201d;&#x2014;Harry S.

This book has been named to the list of books for the 2009 Critics Choice Book Award of the American Educational Studies Association (AESA).</em></strong><br><br>These essays show Angela McRobbie reflecting on a range of issues which have political consequence for women, particularly young women, in a context where it is frequently assumed that progress has been made in the last 30 years, and that with gender issues now &#x2032;mainstreamed&#x2032; in cultural and social life, the moment of feminism per se is now passed. <p></p><p></p><p>McRobbie trenchantly argues that it is precisely on these grounds that invidious forms of gender -re-stabilisation are able to be re-established. Consumer culture, she argues, encroaches on the terrain of so called female freedom, appears supportive of female success only to tie women into new post-feminist neurotic dependencies. </p><p></p><p>These nine essays span a wide range of topics, including </p><p></p><p>- the UK government&#x2032;s &#x2032;new sexual contract&#x2032; to young women, </p><p>- popular TV makeover programmes, </p><p>- feminist theories of backlash and the &#x2032;undoing&#x2032; of sexual politics, </p><p>- feminism in a global frame</p><p>- the &#x2032;illegible rage&#x2032; underlying contemporary femininities.</p></p><p><b>Angela McRobbie</b> is Professor of Communications at Goldsmiths College, London, and her recent books include: <i>British Fashion Design</i> (Routledge, 1998),<i> In the Culture Society</i>, (Routledge, 1999), and <i>Feminism and Youth Culture: Second Edition</i> (Palgrave, 2000)McRobbie has written a profound and profoundly disturbing analysis of the state of feminism in contemporary Britain. Weaving together analyses of culture, economics, politics and everyday life, this is a superb demonstration of why cultural studies matters, and of why McRobbie remains one of its most original and important contributors. This book will enlighten you, anger you, inspire you, and force you to ask new questions - I can&#x2032;t ask for anything more from a book. Author: Larry Grossberg<br><br>McRobbie has produced a landmark text. She argues for a form of feminism that is aware of the contemporary complexities of global media culture while still attentive to political questions of identity, engagement and justice. <em>The Afternath of Feminism</em> is highly sophisticated and theoretically informed, yet also readable and inspiring. It is essential reading for anyone interested in contemporary cultural politics. Author: Claire Colebrook<br><br>Angela McRobbie has written a courageous and much-needed book, exploring the after-effects of the shift to neoliberalism in which young women today can appear to have everything they wanted, presented in an array of choice and empowerment. She interrogates its dark underbelly and exposes the huge losses for women that ensue. Author: Sociology<br><br><p>The inter-disciplinary nature of McRobbie&#x2032;s account is one of its strengths, drawing as it does on psychoanalysis, feminist sociology and cultural studies to provide a powerful breadth of analysis... for a thought-provoking and articulate analysis of what is left for feminism - and what has been lost - this book is excellent.</p> Author: Psychology of Women Review<br><br><p>Angela McRobbie is one of the most prolific and inspiring feminist theorists in the wide field of cultural and media studies... the compilation of these essays in one volume brilliantly shows the consistency in McRobbie&#x2032;s analysis of gender in widely different contemporary cultural products and discourses.</p> Author: Liesbet van Zoonen<br><br><p>To those feminists who assumed that women&#x2019;s increased labor force participation and a handful of legal victories would, perhaps, engender a continuing commitment to socialist-feminist values, <em>The Aftermath of Feminism</em> is a sobering wake-up call. McRobbie&#x2019;s various references to films, television, magazines, and popular culture are not simply a stroll down a post-feminist lane; rather, these texts help illuminate the forms of gender power which help produce and reproduce women&#x2019;s continued domination and subordination. The book is an assault on &#x2032;gender mainstreaming&#x2032;, or the idea that, though feminism may have lost popularity as a public protest movement, it is alive and well &#x2032;behind the scenes&#x2032; in the &#x2032;practical world of women&#x2019;s issues&#x2032;.</p> <p>Read the full review here.</p> Author: International Journal of Communication</p><h2>A History of Business in Medieval Europe, 1200&#x2013;1550 (Cambridge Medieval Textbooks)</h2><p>A History of Business in Medieval Europe, 1200-1550, demolishes the widely held view that the phrase &#34;medieval business&#34; is an oxymoron. The authors review the entire range of business in medieval western Europe, probing its Roman and Christian heritage to discover the economic and political forces that shaped the organization of agriculture, manufacturing, construction, mining, transportation, and marketing. Then they deal with the responses of businessmen to the devastating plagues, famines, and warfare that beset Europe in the late Middle Ages. Medieval businessmen&#39;s remarkable success in coping with this hostile new environment prepared the way for the economic expansion of the sixteenth century.</p><p>James Murray is an Orthopaedic Specialist Registrar, Great Western Hospital, Swindon and Bath Royal United Hospital, UK."...Hunt and Murray provide a very well informed and intelligent exposition of medieval business developments for the nonspecialist."

Speculum</p><h2>The Commercialization of Intimate Life: Notes from Home and Work</h2><p>Arlie Russell Hochschild, author of three <i>New York Times </i>Notable Books, has been one of the freshest and most popular voices in feminist sociology over the last decades. Her influential, unusually perceptive work has opened up new ways of seeing family life, love, gender, the workplace, market transactions&#x2015;indeed, American life itself. This book gathers some of Hochschild's most important and most widely read articles in one place, includes new work, and brings several essays to American audiences for the first time. Each chapter reflects on the complex negotiations we make day to day to juggle the conflicting demands of love and work. Taken together, they are a compelling, often startling, look at how our everyday lives are shaped by modern capitalism. <br><br>These essays, rich with the details of everyday life, explore larger social issues by looking at a series of intimate moments in people's lives. Among them, "Love and Gold" investigates the globalization of love by focusing on care workers who leave their own children and elderly to care for children and the elderly in wealthy countries. In "The Commodity Frontier," Hochschild considers an Internet ad for a "beautiful, smart, hostess, good masseuse&#x2015;$400/week," and explores our responses to personal services for hire. In "From the Frying Pan into the Fire" she asks if capitalism is a religion. In addition to these recent essays, several of Hochschild's important early essays, such as "Inside the Clockwork of Male Careers," have been revised and updated for this collection.</p><p>"A fascinating read, representing the sociological imagination at its freest and finest. Hochschild has a mind nimble enough to dance -- but always to the beat of generous and compassionate heart."&#x2015;Barbara Ehrenreich, author of <i>Nickel and Dimed, On (Not) Getting By in America</i><br><br>"In this set of penetrating and engaging essays, Arlie Hochschild explores the persistent problems of intimacy, family, and care in an increasingly globalized consumer capitalism. Hochschild applies the trademark perception, originality, and human-ness that has made her one of the country's most distinguished and productive sociologists. With their impressive weave of sociological theory, ethnographic research, and analyses of popular culture, these essays are a tour de force."&#x2015;Juliet Schor, author of <i>The Overspent American</i><br><br>"In her new book Arlie Hochschild takes a major step beyond <i>The Second Shift</i> and <i>The Time Bind</i> by illuminating the achievements and pitfalls of what she rightly characterizes as the stalled revolution for gender equality. Hochschild shows that the idea of the traditional nuclear family, or 'family values,' is not the solution to all our social problems, but a monumental hoax. Only major changes in the institutional context of family and work can create the conditions for the warm family life that most Americans want."&#x2015;Robert Bellah, Professor of Sociology, Emeritus, University of California, Berkeley<br><br>"In these remarkable essays, Hochschild breaks the well-established academic rule that to be profound you also have to be obscure. She subtly traces the cultural and structural trends that have objectified and commodified intimacy, emotion, personal commitment, and family life. Her messages are rarely rosy, but never fatalistic, and in all cases carry us beyond conventional wisdom on these elusive topics. Her prose is simultaneously scholarly, insightful, graceful, and full of surprises. What a pleasure it is to welcome this latest work."&#x2015;Neil J. Smelser, author of <i>The Social Edges of Psychoanalysis</i><br><br>"Hochschild's work is innovative. It combines close ethnographic study and attention to the details of family and emotional life, with analyses of wider cultural and social trends. The broad scope of her understanding of social life makes her work unusually insightful."&#x2015;Demie Kurz, author of <i>For Richer, For Poorer: Mothers Confront Divorce</i><b>Arlie Russell Hochschild</b> is Professor of Sociology at the University of California, Berkeley. She is author of <i>The Time Bind: When Work Becomes Home and Home Becomes Work </i>(1997), <i>The Second Shift: Working Parents and the Revolution at Home </i>(1989), and <i>The Managed Heart: Commercialization of Human Feeling </i>(California, 1983), all cited as Notable Books of the Year by the <i>New York Times. </i>She is also author of <i>The Unexpected Community </i>(California, 1973), and she has received the American Sociological Association Award for Public Understanding of Sociology.</p><h2>Calculus--A Complete Introduction: A Teach Yourself Guide</h2><p><p><b>A helpful guide to overcoming calculus</b></p> <p><i>Calculus--A Complete Introduction</i> provides everything you need to broaden your skills and gain confidence.

Nowhere was this affluence more evident than in the houses the family built for themselves in Newport, New York, the Adirondacks, and places in between. King has selected two dozen of the most opulent houses for inclusion in this book. The book is neither a compelling social history nor a unified architectural study; rather, it is a series of images strung together with bits of gossip about individual family members. Fortunately, the individual images are spectacular; numerous color plates and historic photographs tell more about the Vanderbilt lifestyle, and the architecture of Richard Morris Hunt and Warren and Wetmore, than the text is able to do.<br><i>- H.

But it has long been the subject of intense scrutiny by both prison administrators and reformers&#x2014;as well as a source of fascination and anxiety for the American public. Historically, sex behind bars has evoked radically different responses from professionals and the public alike. In <i>Criminal Intimacy</i>, Regina Kunzel tracks these varying interpretations and reveals their foundational influence on modern thinking about sexuality and identity.</p> <p> </p> <p>Historians have held the fusion of sexual desire and identity to be the defining marker of sexual modernity, but sex behind bars, often involving otherwise heterosexual prisoners, calls those assumptions into question. By exploring the sexual lives of prisoners and the sexual culture of prisons over the past two centuries&#x2014;along with the impact of a range of issues, including race, class, and gender; sexual violence; prisoners&#x2019; rights activism; and the HIV epidemic&#x2014;Kunzel discovers a world whose surprising plurality and mutability reveals the fissures and fault lines beneath modern sexuality itself.</p> <p> </p> <p>Drawing on a wide range of sources, including physicians, psychiatrists, sociologists, correctional administrators, journalists, and prisoners themselves&#x2014;as well as depictions of prison life in popular culture&#x2014;Kunzel argues for the importance of the prison to the history of sexuality and for the centrality of ideas about sex and sexuality to the modern prison. In the process, she deepens and complicates our understanding of sexuality in America.</p> <p></p> <p></p></p><p><b>Regina Kunzel</b> is professor of history, professor of gender, women, and sexuality studies, and the Paul R. Frenzel Land Grant Chair in Liberal Arts at the University of Minnesota. She is the author of<i>Fallen Women, Problem Girls: Unmarried Mothers and the Professionalization of Social Work, 1890&#x2013;1945</i>.<p>&#x201c;<i>Criminal Intimacy</i> is simply the best book on the history of sexuality that I&#x2019;ve read in some time. Kunzel has tackled a conceptually and historically elusive topic and treated it with a sure critical sense, a broad chronological sweep, a delicate and subtle tact, and an enviable common sense. She has synthesized a mass of material to produce a coherent narrative, foregrounding issues of class, race, and gender in her analysis without sacrificing complexity or detail. It is beautifully and economically written and a pleasure to read&#x2014;this is not just a good book, but a major one.&#x201d;&#x2014;David Halperin, author of <i>How to Do the History of Homosexuality</i></p> (David Halperin)<br><br><p>&#x201c;<i>Criminal Intimacy</i> shows how the inside world of prison culture both reflects and shapes the outside world&#x2019;s understanding of sexuality. In prose that is lucid, economical, and often elegant, Kunzel offers a sophisticated and persuasive argument that complicates the dominant historical narrative about the emergence of modern homosexuality. The research is prodigious and the primary materials are deftly incorporated throughout this impressive book.&#x201d;&#x2014;Estelle B. Freedman, author of <i>No Turning Back: The History of Feminism and the Future of Women</i></p> (Estelle B. Freedman)<br><br><p>&#x201c;Regina Kunzel has written a pathbreaking study of prison sexual culture from the origins of the penitentiary to the AIDS crisis. She reveals the complex history of inmates&#x2019; same-sex encounters and traces the shifting explanations for prison homosexuality advanced by officials, reformers, and activists.&nbsp;<i>Criminal Intimacy</i> revises our understanding of modern sexual identity, showing how much homosexuality and heterosexuality have been unstable and unconsolidated categories. This is one of the most significant books on the history of American sexuality in recent years.&nbsp;&#x201d;</p> (Kathy Peiss, author of Hope in a Jar: The Making of America&#x2019;s Beauty Culture)<br><br><p>&#x201c;Written with elegance and argued with verve. In this brilliant analysis, Kunzel uses sex in prison to rewrite the history of modern sexual identity. Through meticulous research, she shows us how concerns about sex refracted shifting anxieties about class, race, gender, family, and violence. A sleek, smart, and important book.&#x201d;</p> (Joanne Meyerowitz, author of How Sex Changed: A History of Transsexuality in the United States)<br><br>"<i>Criminal Intimacy</i> successfully conveys the continued sidelining of the complexities of sex in prisons. For even in the face of the constant fear of violence in so many American prisons, Kunzel depicts a world in which sexual love between men, or between women, once it is given the attention it deserves, can still threaten to unsettle dominant conceptions of stable sexual identities. It is this that makes Kunzel's book essential reading for anyone interested in learning more about the multifarious exchanges between sexuality and identity, in any context." (<i>Times Higher Education</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Kunzel&#x2019;s fascinating history of the changing attitudes toward same-sex sex in prisons challenges views of sexuality and gender identity as simple or immutable.&#x201d; (<i>Choice</i>)<br><br>"This much-anticipated book does not disappoint. Regina Kunzel not only offers a long-overdue, rich account of sex in prisons, but uses the institution's position . . . to obtain an important new perspective on modern sexuality. . . . This book will change the way you look at modern sexuality." (Stephen Robertson <i>Journal of American History</i>)<br><br>"[Kunzel] succeeds magnificently in tracing the shifting multiple understandings of sex in prison, with all its complex gender, class, and racial dynamics. . . . This is an important contemporary story. If we thought for a moment that sex in prison was something that happened far away to other people, Kunzel makes us think again." (Leila J. Rupp <i>Women's Review of Books</i>)</p><h2>The Human Potential for Peace: An Anthropological Challenge to Assumptions about War and Violence</h2><p>In <em>The Human Potential for Peace: An Anthropological Challenge to Assumptions about War and Violence</em>, renowned anthropologist Douglas P. Fry shows how anthropology--with its expansive time frame and comparative orientation--can provide unique insights into the nature of war and the potential for peace. Challenging the traditional view that humans are by nature primarily violent and warlike, Professor Fry argues that along with the capacity for aggression humans also possess a strong ability to prevent, limit, and resolve conflicts without violence. Raising philosophy of science issues, the author shows that cultural beliefs asserting the inevitability of violence and war can bias our interpretations, affect our views of ourselves, and may even blind us to the possibility of achieving security without war. Fry draws on data from cultural anthropology, archaeology, and sociology as well as from behavioral ecology and evolutionary biology to construct a biosocial argument that challenges a host of commonly held assumptions. <br> <em>The Human Potential for Peace</em> includes ethnographic examples from around the globe, findings from Fry's research among the Zapotec of Mexico, and results of cross-cultural studies on warfare. In showing that conflict resolution exists across cultures and by documenting the existence of numerous peaceful societies, it demonstrates that dealing with conflict without violence is not merely a utopian dream. The book also explores several highly publicized and interesting controversies, including Freeman's critique of Margaret Mead's writings on Samoan warfare; Napoleon Chagnon's claims about the Yanomamï¿½; and ongoing evolutionary debates about whether "hunter-gatherers" are peaceful or warlike. <em>The Human Potential for Peace</em> is ideal for undergraduate courses in political and legal anthropology, the anthropology of peace and conflict, peace studies, political sociology, and the sociology of war and violence. Written in an informal style with numerous entertaining examples, the book is also readily accessible to general readers.<br></p><p>Douglas P. Fry is at University of Arizona.<br>"<em>The Human Potential for Peace</em> is a real achievement, the first systematic book of its kind, and a welcome part of the anthropological literature. I especially liked the sweep of the book, which broadly covers both the history of aggression as well as the ethnographic record, moving forward to contemporary society and applied implications."--Thomas A. Gregor, Professor of Anthropology, <em>Vanderbilt University</em><p></p><br>"This is an important book, and a serious one, although it is enlivened with a number of anecdotes and personal reminiscences. The book has great strengths, including breadth of scholarship in different areas, as well as a critical depth in tackling some common assumptions and cited conclusions."--Peter K. Smith, Department of Psychology, <em> University College London</em> <br>a href=" http://www.israsociety.com/bulletin/isradec2005.pdf "Read the full review here.<p></p><br>"Amongst the various anthropological texts that have emerged over the last decade, this is clearly one of the most important. At a time when practitioners in the social sciences continue to haggle over the relative merits of interdisciplinary approaches, of paradigm shifts, and of the role of war and peace in human endeavors, this book strikes a relevant chord. Douglas Fry reminds us that in the human experience it is neither solely nature nor nurture, neither aggression nor camaraderie, rather it is a complex synthesis of human endeavors resulting in a clear and resounding potential for peace."--Agustï¿½n Fuentes, Department of Anthropology, <em>University of Notre Dame</em> <br>a href=" http://www.peacefulsocieties.org/NAR/051222gen.html"Read the full review here.<p></p><br></p><h2>Introduction to Electronic Warfare (Artech House Radar Library (Hardcover))</h2><p>This book clearly describes all the radar detection and jamming equations you need to design and analyze search and track radars.

Her realism and biting social commentary has gained her historical importance among scholars and critics, though her work brought her little personal fame and only a few positive reviews during her lifetime. Her plots, though fundamentally comic, highlight the dependence of women on marriage to secure social standing and economic security. Although Jane Austen wrote from her teenage years into her thirties, her most notable writing was done from 1811 until 1816. During this period she wrote and extensively revised three major novels and began a fourth, <i>Sense and Sensibility</i> (1811), <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> (1813),<i> Mansfield Park</i> (1814) and <i>Emma </i>(1816). She wrote two additional novels, <i>Northanger Abbey</i> and <i>Persuasion</i>, both published posthumously in 1818, and began a third, which was eventually titled <i>Sanditon</i>, but she died before completing it at the age of 41.</p></p><h2>The Tolerant Society</h2><p>The First Amendment provides Americans with a far broader protection of free speech than that available in any other Western democracy, Lee Bollinger notes, and yet other democracies are not seen as significantly less open or more restrictive that the United States. Why do Americans guarantee people the right to advocate the overthrow of the government or advance racist or genocidal ideas? Why, for example, protect the right of neo-Nazis to march in predominantly Jewish Skokie, Illinois?<br><br>In The Tolerant Society, Bollinger offers a masterful critique of the major theories of freedom of expression, and offers an alternative explanation. Traditional justifications for protecting extremist speech have turned largely on the inherent value of self-expression, maintaining that the benefits of the free interchange of ideas include the greater likelihood of serving truth and of promoting wise decisions in a democracy. Bollinger finds these theories persuasive but inadequate. Buttrressing his argument with references to the Skokie case and many other examples, as well as a careful analysis of the primary literature on free speech, he contends that the real value of toloeration of extremist speech lies in the extraordinary self-control toward antisocial behavior that it elicits: society is stengthened by the exercise of tolerance, he maintains. The problem of finding an appropriate response--especially when emotions make measured response difficult--is common to all social interaction, Bollinger points out, and there are useful lesons to be learned from withholding punishment even for what is conceded to be bad behavior.<br><br>About the Author:<br><br>Lee C. Bollinger is Professor of Law at the University of Michigan Law School.</p><p>Lee C. Bollinger is at University of Michigan Law School.Bollinger, in this study of the First Amendment, examines some old chest nuts, such as the social and legal implications of the freedom of speech guarantee; the fragile, frequently tense majority rule-minority rights balance; the wisdom of protecting extremist speech. Anent the last, he offers searching comments on Holmes's views in Abrams and Schenck , the landmark Sullivan case, and the legal controversy surrounding Skokie. His study is filled with provocative observations: e.g., John Milton's (and Holmes's) "naive and unduly optimistic" forecast that truth will always prevail over falsehood; the belief that pluralism and diversity have their limits. Continually asking bold, disquieting questions, Ballinger's study is analytic, syncretic, and reaffirmative: legal history at its best.

Divided into seven chronological sections, each with a useful introduction, the letters reveal a woman of alert mind, broad interests, numerous moods and appealing warmth of heart. She also was endowed with a singular capacity to evoke the life around her, ranging from the exoticism of North Africa to the horrors of the World War I front. A large proportion of the letters are to her friends Henry James and Bernard Berenson, while others address Scott Fitzgerald, Andre Gide and Theodore Roosevelt's sister. The letters that show her at her most passionate, and most vulnerable, are those she wrote to her lover Morton Fullerton. R.W.B. Lewis won a Pulitzer Prize for his 1975 Wharton biography; Nancy Lewis is his wife. Photos not seen by PW. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.$29.95. lit Selected from some 4000 letters that span over 60 years, these 400 letters serve to represent Wharton's life and personality. Since her correspondence with Walter Berry and Henry James has not survived, it's probable that what we do have is "second-best." What remains does display Wharton's indefatigable energy, her cultivated intelligence, her unfailing social adeptness, and a kind of efficiency in both thought and emotion. Except for her correspondence with Morton Fullerton, her one-time lover, Wharton's letters are primarily the decisive acts of a social animal. They rarely grope toward the articulation of a feeling, nor do they explore the shadowy limits of her self-awareness. The products of a formidably armored personality, they will be of greatest use to a social historian of the period.

Yet a grasp of these terms can often enhance our enjoyment and understanding of literature. To help clarify the reader's bafflement, <em>The Concise</em> <em>Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms</em> provides succinct and often witty explanations of over one thousand terms, covering everything from the ancient <em>dithyramb</em> to the contemporary <em>dub poetry</em>, from the popular <em>bodice-ripper</em> to the aristocratic <em>masque</em>, and from the <em>social realism</em> of Stalin's era to the <em>magic realism</em> of Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Salman Rushdie. <br> Baldick provides the clearest coverage available of the newly coined terms of important contemporary theories--such as post-structuralism, deconstruction, semiotics, reader-response criticism--offering lucid, up-to-date definitions of terms such as <em>logocentrism</em>, <em>metacriticism</em>, <em>gynocriticism</em>, <em>narratology</em>, and <em>foregrounding</em>. Of course, he also includes extensive coverage of traditional drama, versification, rhetoric, and literary history, of literary schools from Alexandrianism to Transcendentalism, and of terms from languages other than English, such as <em>samizdat</em>, <em>Grand Guignol</em>, and <em>negritude</em>. Throughout, the author's emphasis is on helping readers use these terms more confidently, whether in writing (he includes plural and adjectival forms, and other relevant derivations) or in speaking (easy-to-use pronunciation guides clarify more than 200 potentially troublesome terms). In addition, the dictionary is thoroughly cross-referenced.<br> A model reference book, <em>The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms</em> will prove invaluable for both general readers and literature students at all levels.</p><p><br><em>About the Author</em>:<br> <strong>Chris Baldick</strong> is Senior Lecturer in English at Edge Hill College of Higher Education in Ormskirk, Scotland.<br>Of the many recent dictionaries of literary terms, Baldick's is the one most likely to satisfy today's student. Rejecting "encyclopaedic completeness," it omits commonly understood general terms that are not specifically literary (e.g., art, culture, etc.). Included instead are "many terms generated by the growth of academic literary theory in recent years." The explanations are clear and succinct, and often employ illustrative examples. An uncommon feature of this work is its pronunciation guide, applied to some 200 of the 1000 terms here defined. In addition to the attention paid to the terminology of classical rhetoric, there is a distinct emphasis on French deconstructionist terms derived from Derrida, Barthes, et al. Baldick's chief rival is Northrop Frye's Harper Handbook to Literature (1985), which is more comprehensive but lacks Baldick's currency.

But twenty years into this movement, breakthrough innovations are still rare, and most companies find that 50 to 90 percent of their innovation initiatives flop. The cost of these failures to U.S. companies alone is estimated to be well over $100 billion annually.</p> <p>In a book that challenges everything you have learned about being customer driven, internationally acclaimed innovation leader Anthony Ulwick reveals the secret weapon behind some of the most successful companies of recent years. Known as "outcome-driven" innovation, this revolutionary approach to new product and service creation transforms innovation from a nebulous art into a rigorous science from which randomness and uncertainty are eliminated.</p> <p>Based on more than 200 studies spanning more than seventy companies and twenty-five industries, Ulwick contends that, when it comes to innovation, the traditional methods companies use to communicate with customers are the root cause of chronic waste and missed opportunity. In <i>What Customers Want</i>, Ulwick demonstrates that all popular qualitative research methods yield well-intentioned but unfitting and dreadfully misleading information that serves to derail the innovation process. Rather than accepting customer inputs such as "needs," "benefits," "specifications," and "solutions," Ulwick argues that researchers should silence the literal "voice of the customer" and focus on the "metrics that customers use to measure success when executing the jobs, tasks or activities they are trying to get done." Using these customer desired outcomes as inputs into the innovation process eliminates much of the chaos and variability that typically derails innovation initiatives.</p><p> With the same profound insight, simplicity, and uncommon sense that propelled The Innovator's Solution to worldwide acclaim, this paradigm-changing book details an eight-step approach that uses outcome-driven thinking to dramatically improve every aspect of the innovation process--from segmenting markets and identifying opportunities to creating, evaluating, and positioning breakthrough concepts. Using case studies from Microsoft, Johnson &amp; Johnson, AIG, Pfizer, and other leading companies, <i>What Customers Want</i> shows companies how to:</p> <ul> <li>Obtain unique customer inputs that make predictable innovation possible </li><li>Recognize opportunities for disruption, new market creation, and core market growth--well before competitors do </li><li>Identify which ideas, technologies, and acquisitions have the greatest potential for creating customer value </li><li>Systematically define breakthrough products and services concepts </li></ul> <p>Innovation is fundamental to success and business growth. Offering a proven alternative to failed customer-driven thinking, this landmark book arms you with the tools to unleash innovation, lower costs, and reduce failure rates--and create the products and services customers really want.</p></p><p><p><b>Anthony Ulwick</b> is the CEO of Strategyn, a pioneer and world leader in outcome-driven innovation. Since 1991 he has served as a consultant to Johnson &amp; Johnson, Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard, AIG, Chiquita Brands, and dozens of other leading corporations.

Burchfield: The Sacred Woods</h2><p>Charles E. Burchfield: The Sacred Woods explores the underlying spirituality of American painter Charles E. Burchfield (1893-1967). Author Nancy Weekly, the Charles Cary Rumsey Curator of the Burchfield Art Center, traces the evolution of his art and philosophical fluctuations. She identifies his affinity for developments in 19th century art and literature, including pantheism, luminism, romanticism, and transcendentalism. The book celebrates the 100th anniversary of Burchfield's birth. It is complemented by 40 color plates and 60 black and white illustrations.<br>Burchfield was born in 1893 in Ashtabula, Ohio, and grew up in Salem, Ohio, which is depicted in youthful studies of nature, painted until he graduated from the Cleveland School of Art in 1916. His early work shares decorative compositional qualities with 19th century Japanese woodblock prints and reveals the influence of prevalent pantheistic philosophies and the literature of American authors, such as Henry David Thoreau, Walt Whitman, and Ralph Waldo Emerson. During 1917, which Burchfield called his "golden year," he exaggerated nature's sounds and movements in synesthetic, animated fantasies and invented a highly personal set of symbols he called "Conventions for Abstract Thoughts" to represent dreaded human emotions such as fear and morbidness.<br>Surprisingly, during the 1920s when Burchfield still harbored the doubts of his youthful apostasy, he produced a small number of prints, drawings, and paintings based on Biblical subjects. After designing wallpapers for the M. H. Birge &amp; Sons Company in Buffalo, New York from 1921 to 1929, the artist resigned to devote himself fully to his painting, encouraged by Frank K. M. Rehn of New York, who offered to be his art dealer. Burchfield became known as a painter of the American Scene, the champion of unpretentious small town life, as well as the urban documentarian who recorded the ennui of a man-made landscape, often being compared with his Rehn Gallery colleague, Edward Hopper.<br>Dissatisfied with painting realistically, Burchfield returned in the 1940s to his fanciful style of 1917 and expanded old ideas, even the actual paintings themselves, into larger and more meaningful interpretations of nature. A lifetime of spiritual soul-searching and self-doubt, the recurrence of serious illnesses, and the steady persuasiveness of his wife, Bertha, led to Burchfield's eventual adoption of the Lutheran faith in 1943-44. Autobiographical, romantic landscapes of this period contain his symbols for man's place in the universal scheme.<br>Majestic, transcendental evocations of the power of nature characterize the last decade of Burchfield's works. The pinnacle of Burchfield's aspirations is evidenced in his concept of a Mystic North, an imaginary, legendary place of deep mystery and elusive tranquility that he found in the secluded woods of the Western New York countryside. This, coupled with significant childhood memories provided hope for eternal peacefulness and serenity in paintings that are truly visionary. In April 1964, Burchfield wrote, "...[I] will always be searching [for] the ultimate statement. It is better so. The search for a truth is better than the realization. North is an arbitrary term - It is the Pole that my imagination yearns for - ".</p><p>Nancy Weekly is the Charles Cary Rumsey Curator of the Burchfield Art Center and Lecturer in the Design Department at Buffalo State College.</p><h2>The Broadview Anthology of British Literature: Volume 5: The Victorian Era</h2><p>In all six of its volumes The Broadview Anthology of British Literature presents British literature in a truly distinctive light.

It also offers tantalizing glimpses of medieval Japan and the technology underlying the material culture of the samurai. Some objects are dazzling aesthetic and technical feats: impossibly intricate lacquerware, swords as bright and sharp as the day they were forged, and glittering suits of armor from daimyo collections. Others are more unassuming, but equally capable of evoking visions of a lost world. Readers will encounter commoners alternately fearful of samurai violence and swept up in the romance of the cult of loyalty; artists and writers conjuring scenes of adventure and wit; families reaching out to departed kin across the chasm of death; parents deciding whether to raise or reject a newborn baby; underground Christians hiding their faith behind a Buddhist icon; and Japanese artifacts that take on new meanings in Ainu villages and the parlors of New England collectors.<br> &nbsp;<br> This book covers some well-known facets of Japanese history, but also features cutting-edge research. Like the exhibition from which it emerges, it is designed to be engaging and accessible to the general public while offering experts new information and perspectives.</p><p><b>Fabian Drixler</b>&nbsp;is associate professor of history at Yale University.&nbsp;<b>William D.

But please don't shy away because you are afraid of yet another relentless tale of misery. My interest in this story has always focussed on the drama of the situation. I write in a conversational style, so you'll find plenty of lighter moments. One reviewer wrote: "&nbsp;<i>A Good Place To Hide</i>&nbsp;combines solid historical research with the tension of a spy novel." Thank you&nbsp;<i>Shelf Awareness</i>, that's exactly what I was aiming for.&nbsp; The story is largely unknown because the participants got into such a habit of secrecy that they found it difficult to come out into the open after the war, even though the danger had passed. Let me tell you a story. If you read the book, you'll get to know a Protestant schoolgirl Catherine Cambessï¿½dï¿½s, who ran suitcases full of money and other supplies for the French Resistance. She risked her life doing it. You'll also meet Nelly Trocmï¿½, the oldest daughter of the pacifist pastor Andrï¿½ Trocmï¿½, who inspired so much of the rescue operation that is the subject of the book. Catherine and Nelly were best friends at school, and they stayed in touch after the war. They both moved to the United States, they both married, and they both had children. Nelly suggested that I go and talk to Catherine when I was researching the book, which is how I first met her.&nbsp; Teenage school friendships are pretty close, full of shared secrets. Yet Nelly found out about Catherine's wartime Resistance activities&nbsp;<i>only when she read my book, 70 years later</i>. That's how closely wartime secrets were guarded in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon and the surrounding villages.&nbsp; My first two books were set in Australia during World War 2. The first dealt with the Japanese midget submarine raid on Sydney Harbour on 31 May 1942. The second dealt with the Japanese bombing of Darwin on 19 February 1942. Both battles were military fiascos. Australia was unprepared. Her soldiers and sailors were under-trained, poorly equipped and badly led. Very different books from&nbsp;<i>A Good Place To Hide</i>, you might think. But to me all three books are inspired by the same thought: these are dramatic&nbsp;<i>stories</i>, and my interest has always been in a dramatic narrative.&nbsp;&nbsp; So if you decide to read&nbsp;<i>A Good Place To Hide</i>&nbsp;and are surprised to find yourself in the midst of an exotic cast list -- a teenage Jewish typewriter repairman who became a master forger; a female American spy with a wooden leg, which she called Cuthbert; the novelist Albert Camus working on the first draft of his masterpiece&nbsp;<i>La Peste</i>&nbsp;("The Plague"); an unswerving pacifist pastor who was awarded the Medal of the Resistance with Rosette, a rare French military distinction -- then I can only apologise for startling you, and make a plea in mitigation that I find it hard to resist anything that makes for a good story.Nobody asked questions, nobody demanded money.

As with all the books in the series, the aim is to provide students, unfamiliar with the subject, with an up-to-date account of what happened and why, in as brief a span as possible. <br> <br>The book opens with a general discussion of the Risorgimento and how the events leading to Italian unification in 1861 have been interpreted by historians. Dr Clark then takes the reader through the events of the first half of the nineteenth century in a series of concise chapters. Full attention is given to the social, economic and religious context, to regional diversities, as well as to the rise of Cavour, foreign diplomacy and the military exploits of Garibaldi. Throughout, the broader European context is emphasised and the subject is related to today s issues. The author argues that, despite appearances, the Risorgimento was not a national insurrection and that any national sentiment was limited to a small, educated urban minority. <br> <br>Illustrating the major themes in the book is a fascinating selection of original documents, translated into English specially for this volume. Included amongst them is a description of Garibaldi by a contemporary follower; and a cheque, sent to Garibaldi by a group of Scottish Friends of Italy , and signed by Garibaldi himself. As additional tools the author has provided a chronology of the main events, a glossary of terms, and two maps. Concise, accessible, and enormously readable - the book is an important addition to the series.<br> </p>Martin Clark is Reader in the Department of Politics, University of Edinburgh.</p><h2>Mutiny on the Amistad: The Saga of a Slave Revolt and Its Impact on American Abolition, Law, and Diplomacy</h2><p>This volume presents the first full-scale treatment of the only instance in history where African blacks, seized by slave dealers, won their freedom and returned home. Jones describes how, in 1839, Joseph Cinquï¿½ led a revolt on the Spanish slave ship, the <em>Amistad</em>, in the Caribbean. The seizure of the ship by an American naval vessel near Montauk, Long Island, the arrest of the Africans in Connecticut, and the Spanish protest against the violation of their property rights created an international controversy.<br> The <em>Amistad</em> affair united Lewis Tappan and other abolitionists who put the "law of nature" on trial in the United States by their refusal to accept a legal system that claimed to dispense justice while permitting artificial distinctions based on race or color. The mutiny resulted in a trial before the U.S. Supreme Court that pitted former President John Quincy Adams against the federal government. Jones vividly recaptures this compelling drama--the most famous slavery case before Dred Scott--that climaxed in the court's ruling to free the captives and allow them to return to Africa.<br></p><p><br><strong>Howard Jones</strong> is Professor of History at the University of Alabama and author of <em>The Course of American Diplomacy</em> and <em>To the Webster-Ashburton Treaty</em>.<br><br>"A nearly flawless historical study of an important episode in American diplomatic, legal, political, and ethnic history; <em>Mutiny on the Amistad</em> raises important questions in all of these fields and is highly recommended reading."--<em>Journal of American Ethnic History</em><p></p><br>"<em>Mutiny on the Amistad</em> is based on thorough research and provides excellent and detailed coverage of its subject.

The printed copy, the traditional archive, and analogue research remain key constitute parts for most historians and for many will remain precious and esteemed over digital copies, but there is a real need for historians and students of history to seriously consider some of the conceptual and methodological challenges facing the field of historical enquiry as we enter the twenty-first century. </p> <p></p> <p>Including international contributors from a variety of disciplines - History, English, Information Studies and Archivists &#x2013; this book does not seek either to applaud or condemn digital technologies, but takes a more conceptual view of how the field of history is being changed by the digital age. Essential reading for all historians. </p></p><p><p>"This is a book that is well overdue. At long last it provides an account of Digital History as a field with something to offer to the discipline as a whole. It should be read by anyone who thinks that developments in IT are likely to change the way historians work, whether they are enthusiasts, critics or just curious." - <strong>Dr Ian Gregory</strong>, <em>Lancaster University, UK</em></p> <p>"Drawing on an international and interdisciplinary set of authors, this book brings together many of the key issues in the nascent field of Digital History, and examines the multiplicity of ways in which digital sources, digital projects, and digital methodologies have impacted the study, practice, and teaching of history itself. Arguing for the increasing centrality to historians from students to scholars of understanding the creation, preservation, and use of traditional, digitized, and born-digital sources, <i>History in the Digital Age</i> grapples with the methodological and practical implications of shifting from information scarcity to information flood, of engaging with multiple mediums of historical sources and projects, and of retaining history&#x2019;s scholarly and theoretical rigor. <em>History in the Digital Age</em> is strongly recommended for anyone interested in the future of history." - <strong>Jeffrey W. McClurken</strong>, <em>University of Mary Washington, USA</em></p> <p>"The importance of the role of digital resources in academic life is highlighted by the recent emergence of the new discipline of digital humanities at many universities around the world. In this context, the collection of essays under review addresses pedagogical issues around the study and teaching of history in the digital age...[and] those who have concerns about the role of digitization in the historical discipline will find much here to ponder...in a way that is informative and challenging." - <strong>Thomas P.

In profiling compelling young American innovators such as Kirk Phelps, product manager for Apple&#x2019;s first iPhone, and Jodie Wu, who founded a company that builds bicycle-powered maize shellers in Tanzania, Wagner reveals how the adults in their lives nurtured their creativity and sparked their imaginations, while teaching them to learn from failures and persevere. Play, passion, and purpose: These are the forces that drive young innovators.<br> <br>Wagner takes readers into the most forward-thinking schools, colleges, and workplaces in the country, where teachers and employers are developing cultures of innovation based on collaboration, interdisciplinary problem-solving, and intrinsic motivation. The result is a timely, provocative, and inspiring manifesto that offers crucial insight into creating the change makers of tomorrow.</p><p>Tony Wagner&nbsp;currently serves as an Expert In Residence at Harvard University&#x2019;s Innovation Lab. Previously he has worked as a high school teacher, K-8 principal, university professor, and founding executive director of Educators for Social Responsibility. Tony is a frequent speaker at national and international conferences and the author of <i>Creating Innovators</i> and <i>The Global Achievement Gap</i>.Creating Innovators Introduction<p></p> <br>Recent events and new questions and insights have compelled me to write this book.<br> <br>My last book, The Global Achievement Gap, published in 2008, described the new skills students need for careers, college, and citizenship in the twenty-first century and the growing gap between these skills versus what is taught and tested in our schools. Judging by the outpouring of positive responses to the book from diverse audiences and the many subsequent speaking requests I received from all corners of the world, it would appear that I got a number of things right in that book. But I now see that the new skills I described&#x2014;which I call the Seven Survival Skills&#x2014;while necessary, are not sufficient.<br> <br>The world has changed profoundly since 2008. The economies of the West are in shambles. In the United States, the combined rate of unemployment and underemployment is more than 15 percent, and in some European countries it is far worse. Many economists say the solution is for consumers to start spending again, thus creating new jobs. But most consumers can no longer borrow money as easily as they once did. And because many fear for their jobs, they are now saving at a far greater rate than just a few years ago. It is not clear when&#x2014;or even if&#x2014;our consumer-driven economy and accompanying low unemployment rates will ever return. Meanwhile, both economists and policy makers are caught up in fierce debates about whether to reduce debt or provide more economic stimulus, which would in the short term increase government debt.<br> <br>Most leaders agree on one thing, however. The long-term health of our economy and a full economic recovery are dependent upon creating far more innovation. New or improved ideas, products, and services create wealth and new jobs. Business leaders, in particular, say that we need many more young people who can create innovations in the areas of science, technology, and engineering. Many argue that so-called STEM education (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) is increasingly important to the future of our country. Republicans, Democrats, and Independents alike say that for our young people to be better prepared for high-wage, high-skilled jobs, they must all graduate from high school &#x201c;college ready&#x201d; and earn a two-year or four-year postsecondary degree&#x2014;preferably in a STEM-related field. Thomas Friedman and Michael Mandelbaum take the argument even further in their recent book, That Used to Be Us, asserting that only the jobs of innovators and entrepreneurs will be immune to outsourcing or automation in the new global knowledge economy.<br> <br>At the same time as these arguments have gained traction, there has also been a growing concern about the cost of a college education and whether college students are learning very much in their classes. In 2010, college debt&#x2014;estimated at $1 trillion&#x2014;exceeded credit card debt for the first time.1 And in early 2011, a new study revealed that, after two years of college, nearly half of all students were no more skillful than when they began their studies, and fully one-third showed no gains after four years.2 Statistics show college graduates earn far more than high school graduates. But is that because they are actually more skilled or because the credential has become a simple way to weed through the forest of rï¿½sumï¿½s?<br> <br>Given the near consensus on the vital importance of innovation in today&#x2019;s economy, I decided to explore the question of how you educate young people to become innovators. What are the capacities that matter most for innovation, and how are they best taught? I became especially interested in what truly constitutes a meaningful STEM education.<br> <br>The question of how teachers can develop those students skills that matter most for our country&#x2019;s future has become even more urgent for me as I have followed the recent education-reform debates in the United States and elsewhere. I am frankly appalled at the idea, now widely held, that the best measure of teachers&#x2019; effectiveness is students&#x2019; performance on standardized, multiple-choice tests. I am not a fan of teacher tenure, and I believe strongly in accountability for improved student learning. However, most policy makers&#x2014;and many school administrators&#x2014;have absolutely no idea what kind of instruction is required to produce students who can think critically and creatively, communicate effectively, and collaborate versus merely score well on a test. They are also clueless about what kind of teaching best motivates this generation to learn. And the tests that policy makers continue to use as an indication of educational progress do not measure any of the skills that matter most today. We need more profiles of quality instruction&#x2014;and better sources of evidence of results&#x2014;to inform the education debate.<br> <br>Since the publication of The Global Achievement Gap, I have been inundated with e-mails from concerned parents. They know their children&#x2019;s schools are not teaching the skills that they will need, and the parents want to know what they can do. I have my own experience as the father of three wonderful children, now grown with children of their own, but that hardly seems like a sufficient basis for giving advice to other parents. How do parents nurture some of the important skills and attributes of their children? I began to wonder.<br> <br>In the last few years, I have had opportunities to work with highly innovative companies such as Apple, Cisco Systems, and Scholastic, as well as with senior leaders in the US Army. I have been fascinated by how these leaders see the world and deal with the accelerating pace of change. I became interested in what the best employers do to develop the capacities of young people to be innovators. I also recently met with education leaders and visited schools in Finland, whose education system is considered the best in the world. It is also credited with helping to produce one of the most innovative economies in the world. I wanted to explore what lessons we might learn from Finland&#x2019;s success.<br> <br>Finally, I have continued to be intrigued by this so-called net generation&#x2014;the first to grow up as what Marc Prensky calls &#x201c;digital natives.&#x201d; I interviewed a number of twentysomethings for the last book, but felt I had only scratched the surface of understanding this generation. Since then, the debate about this generation&#x2019;s work ethic&#x2014;or lack of one&#x2014;has continued to rage. So I wanted to better understand how they might be differently motivated, and what kinds of teaching and leadership they respond to most positively.<br> <br>Out of all these disparate influences and questions an idea for a new book began to emerge. I resolved, first, to take a leap and become a student of innovation&#x2014;something about which I knew little until a few years ago. I have tried to understand what the skills of successful innovators are and why are they so important to our future. I interviewed highly innovative twentysomethings and then studied their &#x201c;ecosystems&#x201d;&#x2014;the parental, teaching, and mentoring influences that they told me had been most important in their development. I wanted to see if I could discern patterns of parenting that contribute to the nurturing of young innovators. And what about the teachers whom these innovators identified as having been most important in their development&#x2014;were there any similarities in their methods? Are there colleges or graduate programs that do an excellent job of teaching the skills of innovation, and if so, how might they be different? I also sought to learn what the mentors and employers of young innovators had to say about how these capacities are best fostered.<br> <br>I&#x2019;ve interviewed scores of diverse young innovators&#x2014;budding engineers, scientists, artists, musicians, and other individuals who have started companies or worked for some of the most innovative companies in the world, as well social innovators and entrepreneurs who are seeking better ways to solve societal problems. I then interviewed their parents, teachers, and mentors. I observed classes and conducted interviews at several colleges and graduate programs that have an international reputation for graduating innovators. Finally, I interviewed business and military leaders who are dealing with the challenges of developing organizational capacities to innovate. In all, I conducted more than 150 interviews for this book.<br> <br>It has been an utterly fascinating project, but also challenging because of its scope and complexity. For this reason, I decided to limit the innovators whom I profile in this book to young people between the ages of twenty-one and thirty-two who fall into one of two categories: individuals who are doing highly innovative work in so-called STEM fields, and individuals engaged in social innovation and entrepreneurship. The former are critical to our economic future, the latter to our social and civic well-being. I have also chosen to combine the categories of innovators and entrepreneurs. I am well aware that not every young innovator is an entrepreneur or vice versa. However, I discovered that the majority of the young people whom I interviewed aspire to be both, and that young innovators and entrepreneurs&#x2014;regardless of their areas of interest&#x2014;share some common roots.<br> <br>Describing how I found the people I interviewed would take another book. Research for this project has been much like the process of following hyperlinks on the Internet. Several of my student researchers suggested names of young people whom they had met or read about, while angel investors and venture capitalists introduced me to others. Some individuals&#x2014;such as General Martin Dempsey&#x2014;found me. One source would take me to another and that one to the next. I make no claims to a &#x201c;scientific&#x201d; sampling. However, based on all that I have learned in the last three years, I have a high degree of confidence that the innovators whom I profile in depth are a representative sample.<br> <br>I am enormously grateful to the innovators I write about here, as well as the ones whom I had to leave out for space reasons, and to all of their parents, teachers, and mentors. Everyone gave me hours of their time&#x2014;often over several interviews and in follow-up e-mails&#x2014;and allowed me complete access to their life and family history.<br> <br>Thanks to the persistence and hard work of Bob Compton, you will not only meet many of these people between the pages of this book, you will also be able to see and hear them on camera. Bob&#x2014;who himself has had a remarkable career as a high-tech innovator, entrepreneur, and angel investor&#x2014;has recently focused his energies on producing an outstanding set of videos about education. His first, 2 Million Minutes, was screened by all of the presidential candidates in 2008 and has sold more than twenty thousand copies. We met at an Investment in America Forum at West Point several years ago, and we recently collaborated on a film about Finland&#x2019;s education system, The Finland Phenomenon: Inside the World&#x2019;s Most Surprising School System.3 When I told Bob about plans for this new book, he urged me to make it a truly innovative book in its format&#x2014;and not just a book about innovation. So throughout these pages, you will find a series of QR tags, which, if you scan them with your cell or smartphone&#x2019;s camera and the appropriate software, will take you to web pages where you can watch videos related to the innovators&#x2019; lives and the schools I describe.<br> <br>Whether you are a parent, teacher (preschool through college), mentor, employer, or policy maker, I think you will find that the print and video profiles of these young innovators, as well as the ecosystems that have helped them to develop their capacities, have a great deal to teach us all. I know that I was&#x2014;and continue to be&#x2014;inspired by the people whom I interviewed for this project. So I invite you to read, watch, listen, learn&#x2014;and then to reflect, share, and discuss with your friends and colleagues. For if we are to create a strong economic future and a sustainable way of life for our children and grandchildren, we all have much that we can and must do together.<br> <br>Wagner on Why I Wrote This Book<br> <br><br> <br>http://creatinginnovators.com/chapter00Tag01-5</p><h2>Sams Teach Yourself C++ in One Hour a Day</h2><p><b>Learn C++ in Just One Hour a Day</b> <br> <br>Completely updated for the C++11 standard, <b>Sams Teach Yourself C++ in One Hour a Day </b>presents the language from a practical point of view, helping you learn how to use C++11 to create faster, simpler, and more efficient C++ applications. <p> </p> <ul> <li>Master the fundamentals of C++ and object-oriented programming </li> <li>Understand how C++11 features help you write compact and efficient code using concepts such as lambda expressions, move constructors, and assignment operators </li> <li>Learn the Standard Template Library, including containers and algorithms used in most real-world C++ applications </li> <li>Test your knowledge and expertise using exercises at the end of every lesson</li> </ul> <p> </p> <b> <p>Learn on your own time, at your own pace: </p> </b> <ul> <li>No previous programming experience required </li> <li>Learn C++11, object-oriented programming, and analysis </li> <li>Write fast and powerful C++ programs, compile the source code with a gcc compiler, and create executable files </li> <li>Use the Standard Template Library&#x2019;s (STL) algorithms and containers to write feature-rich yet stable C++ applications </li> <li>Develop sophisticated programming techniques using lambda expressions, smart pointers, and move constructors </li> <li>Learn to expand your program&#x2019;s power with inheritance and polymorphism </li> <li>Master the features of C++ by learning from programming experts </li> <li>Learn C++11 features that allow you to program compact and high-performance C++ applications</li> </ul> <b>TABLE OF CONTENTS</b> <br> <p> <br> </p> <p> <b>PART I: THE BASICS</b> </p> <p>LESSON 1: Getting Started with C++11<br> </p> <p>LESSON 2: The Anatomy of a C++ Program</p> <p>LESSON 3: Using Variables, Declaring Constants</p> <p>LESSON 4: Managing Arrays and Strings</p> <p>LESSON 5: Working with Expressions, Statements, and Operators</p> <p>LESSON 6: Controlling Program Flow</p> <p>LESSON 7: Organizing Code with Functions </p> <p>LESSON 8: Pointers and References Explained</p> <p> <br> </p> <p> <b>PART II: FUNDAMENTALS OF OBJECT-ORIENTED C++ PROGRAMMING</b> </p> <p>LESSON 9: Classes and Objects</p> <p>LESSON 10: Implementing Inheritance</p> <p>LESSON 11: Polymorphism</p> <p>LESSON 12: Operator Types and Operator Overloading</p> <p>LESSON 13: Casting Operators</p> <p>LESSON 14: An Introduction to Macros and Templates</p> <br> <p> <b>PART III: LEARNING THE STANDARD TEMPLATE LIBRARY (STL)</b> </p> <p>LESSON 15: An Introduction to the Standard Template Library</p>LESSON 16: The STL String Class<br>LESSON 17: STL Dynamic Array Classes<br>LESSON 18: STL list and forward_list<br>LESSON 19: STL Set Classes<br>LESSON 20: STL Map Classes<br> <p> <br> </p> <p> <b>PART IV: MORE STL</b> </p> <p>LESSON 21: Understanding Function Objects</p>LESSON 22: C++11 Lambda Expressions<br>LESSON 23: STL Algorithms<br>LESSON 24: Adaptive Containers: Stack and Queue<br>LESSON 25: Working with Bit Flags Using STL<br> <p> <br> </p> <p> <b>PART V: ADVANCED C++ CONCEPTS</b> </p> <p>LESSON 26: Understanding Smart Pointers</p>LESSON 27: Using Streams for Input and Output<br>LESSON 28: Exception Handling<br>LESSON 29: Going Forward<p> <br> </p> <p> <b>APPENDIXES</b> </p> <p>A: Working with Numbers: Binary and Hexadecimal</p> <p>B: C++ Keywords</p> <p>C: Operator Precedence</p> <p>D: Answers</p> <p>E: ASCII Codes</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p></p><p><b> <br>Learn C++ in Just One Hour a Day!</b> <br> <br> <p>In just one hour a day, you&#x2019;ll have all the skills you need to begin programming in C++.

A contributor to Harper&#x2019;s Magazine and the New York Times Magazine, he currently teaches at the University of Arizona.1<br>In Search of the Unfound<br><br>On this pleasant evening of July 1996, the long, narrow chapter room at the <br>rural Kentucky abbey of Our Lady of Gethsemani was filled with monks. <br>Along the right wall, under an image of the risen Christ, stood our Trappist <br>hosts, the "white monks," dressed in white robes covered with black hooded <br>scapulars and cinched at their waists with broad leather belts. Next to <br>them, wearing black robes, stood the Benedictines, the "black monks," the <br>more publicly engaged, apostolic of the Roman Catholic contemplative <br>orders. Among these monks were scattered a few women, most dressed in <br>the white blouse and below-the-knee gray skirt favored by many post&#x2013;Vatican <br>II sisters. Along the left wall, under a batik banner of the seated Buddha, <br>stood the Buddhist monks, some wearing maroon trimmed with saffron, <br>others wearing saffron trimmed with maroon. A single Japanese monk wore <br>dove-gray robes trimmed in black and white; a single Taiwanese nun wore <br>saffron, peach fuzz sprouting from her newly shaven head. Among these <br>Asians mingled the American Buddhists&#x2014;some wearing black Zen robes, <br>some wearing street clothes. Some of the Asians were Americans, <br>naturalized priests and monks whose Buddhist congregations include <br>American Jews and Roman Catholics and Protestants. The Christians and <br>the American Buddhists were almost all Caucasian; the Asians ranged from <br>Japanese ivory to Sri Lankan browned butter. Timothy Kelly, abbot of <br>Gethsemani, and the exiled Dalai Lama of Tibet stood at front center, focal <br>point for this international convocation of Buddhist and Christian monks and <br>lay contemplatives.<br> The assembly presented a picture postcard of institutionalized <br>religion, East and West: a few men on the stage ran the show, while the <br>women&#x2014;a clear majority of those present&#x2014;looked on. But one does not <br>expect an embrace of gender equality from religious institutions, and I <br>settled into the territory with a familiar interior sigh. I had been invited as a <br>writer, which is to say as a kind of anthropologist whose job is to reserve <br>judgment and simply observe. A significant aspect of that observation is to <br>learn and follow local customs, and so when the time came to perform the <br>first Buddhist bows, I followed the example of my neighbor and bent&#x2014;<br>although not too deeply; I saw myself as a skeptic and an American, inheritor <br>and expression of centuries of Enlightenment rationalism. All people are <br>created equal; liberty, equality, fraternity&#x2014;this was my creed and my mantra, <br>and I was not much given to bowing to anyone, whether to the pope or the <br>Dalai Lama. But the writer does what he must do for the sake of the story, <br>and so when the Dalai Lama passed I imitated my neighbor, ducking my <br>head and joining my palms.<br> Then Abbot Kelly took the microphone and called upon us to <br>pray, opening with the sign of the cross. Here I had no need to look to a <br>neighbor; I have known this script since before memory&#x2014;the fingers to the <br>forehead, the heart, the left then the right shoulder, a simple gesture I once <br>inhabited as easily as lifting my hand to wave goodbye . . . and I could not do <br>it. All around me Roman Catholics made the sign of the cross, but my right <br>hand remained at my side. The abbot"s prayer was brief; before long he <br>closed it by repeating the gesture. Again my hands hung stubbornly at my <br>sides, dead weight. Even for the sake of the story, the body refused to go <br>where the mind willed.<br> Here among the believers, seated at the foot of the bloody Christ <br>for longer than any time since the Lenten vigils of my childhood, I was <br>stunned by the anger that simmered up from some repressed place. I was <br>possessed by anger&#x2014;the pit in the gut, the quickening pulse; I recognized <br>the signs. I was angry at the institution of the church, any church; angry at <br>myself for letting it get to me (all that therapy for nothing); angry at being so <br>alone in my anger.<br> Or so I thought. Then across the following six days of this <br>convocation of Christians and Buddhists from North America, Asia, and <br>Europe, most of whom had dedicated their lives to contemplation, I <br>discovered one word that arose so often that finally conferees agreed to a <br>moratorium on the subject, and still it returned: anger.<br> Evidently I was not as alone as I had thought.<br> What was the source of this anger? The ready and obvious <br>answer would be sexual repression or its aftereffects, but I am suspicious of <br>ready and obvious answers. Desire in all its manifestations lies at the heart <br>of what it means to be human&#x2014;I know this from experience, and I would <br>shortly learn that Buddhism posits as much in its first, foundational principle. <br>But desire assumes many guises. Again and again the convocation <br>participants returned to the subject of anger, but they were discussing a <br>symptom, not a cause; the cause might be more accurately described as <br>longing, with anger the result of its frustration.<br> But what were we longing for, and why was it yet unfound? I could <br>not then address that question, but thanks to those hands, rigid at my <br>sides, I understood this much: anger had taken up residence in my house, <br>where it had dwelt long enough to take control. And&#x2014;child of Western <br>psychology&#x2014;I understood that I must engage that anger if I was to find peace.<br><br>This particular leg of my journey began a few months earlier in my <br>Kentucky hometown at the Sherwood Inn, the hotel-tavern acquired by my <br>great-grandfather Thomas Hardin Johnson in the mid-1870s and run by my <br>family in the century-plus since. On a bright spring afternoon in March 1996 I <br>was visiting for the celebration of my mother"s eightieth birthday and standing <br>on the Sherwood porch when my aunt poked her head out the door to tell me <br>there was a knock at the back door.<br> At the Sherwood "a knock at the back door" usually means one <br>thing, so I cut through the bar, grabbed a couple of beers, and went out <br>back to greet one of the monks from the nearby Trappist monastery, Our <br>Lady of Gethsemani, a crow"s mile across the Kentucky hills. Brother Paul <br>Quenon, tall, ascetically thin, and slightly grizzled as befits a poet-monk, had <br>hiked over the steep hills that the locals call "the Knobs" to let me know that <br>in the approaching summer Gethsemani would host an international <br>convocation of Buddhist and Christian monks and lay contemplatives, with <br>the Dalai Lama of Tibet in attendance. Almost thirty years in its ripening, the <br>Gethsemani Encounter was the fruit of a 1968 meeting between the Dalai <br>Lama and Thomas Merton, author of The Seven Storey Mountain, the <br>bestselling autobiography of Merton"s journey toward joining the Gethsemani <br>community as a Trappist monk.<br> I did not know Brother Paul well. We first met because someone <br>recommended his poetry to me and I was curious&#x2014;what would it be like to <br>be a poet inside the enclosure? He"d joined Gethsemani in the early 1960s, <br>had Merton for his novicemaster, and taken solemn vows in 1968. But Paul <br>was among the more private monks, not one who came to town to buy <br>hammers or nails and who occasionally visited community families. On that <br>particular spring day he wasn"t delivering pressing news&#x2014;a thunderstorm or <br>a wrong turn on the path and I"d never have received it. I"d have been back in <br>San Francisco, struggling with my next book, which I was certain would be <br>a novel.<br> I accepted Brother Paul"s invitation to attend the Gethsemani <br>Encounter partly as a means of dodging the looming terror of beginning that <br>novel. I"d been considering creating a Buddhist doctor and a Trappist monk <br>as its principal characters, but I knew little about Buddhism and not much <br>more about monastic practice. What better way to learn about these, I told <br>myself, than to spend a few months researching an article about the <br>contemplative life?<br> Years later I see with the crystalline vision of hindsight that my <br>decision to attend the Encounter was not a casual detour but another step <br>in an unfolding path. After all, my fate is so common the French assign it a <br>name&#x2014;le donnï¿½, the youngest child who is given to the church. Until recent <br>times the progression among sons was clear and unyielding: the oldest <br>male inherited the property; the second went to the military; the third went to <br>the government; the fourth went to the church. Ninth of nine children, fourth of <br>four boys, bookish, homosexual, I had "religious orders" all but engraved on <br>my forehead; I was destined for the church.<br> But I also came of age in the 1960s, those tumultuous years in <br>which all traditions were open for questioning and in many cases dismissal. <br>For reasons this journey will bring me to reconsider, I determined early on <br>never to set foot in a church except to please my mother&#x2014;and sometimes <br>not then.<br> A visit with American Christian and Buddhist monks would provide <br>a quick look at the road not taken&#x2014;that was how I justified my decision to <br>attend the Encounter. I would go as a tourist, someone who rents a car, <br>checks into a hotel, spends a day or two driving around, and returns home <br>filled with tales about the quaint and charming ways "they" do things. I"ll <br>learn Buddhism in a few months, I thought, pick up a few stories from the <br>monks, and combine these for a quick article. Then I"ll get back to the novel <br>and my comfortable life in my beloved San Francisco, city of self-satisfaction.<br> But one embarks on an interior journey at peril of one"s whole way <br>of being. What I"d planned as a quick week"s visit turned into a <br>cross-country journey through the briars and thistles of faith and (its traveling <br>companion) desire, with no compass save for an inquiring but ignorant heart. <br>What follows is a chronicle of a skeptic"s journey into the wilderness, a <br>casual excursion that transformed itself into a search for what it means to <br>have and to keep faith.<br><br>Copyright ï¿½ 2003 by Fenton Johnson.

Fully grounded in sound literary and historical scholarship, the anthology takes a fresh approach to many canonical authors, and includes a wide selection of work by lesser-known writers. The anthology also provides wide-ranging coverage of the worldwide connections of British literature, and it pays attention throughout to issues of race, gender, class, and sexual orientation. It includes comprehensive introductions to each period, providing in each case an overview of the historical and cultural as well as the literary background. It features accessible and engaging headnotes for all authors, extensive explanatory annotations throughout, and an unparalleled number of illustrations and contextual materials, offering additional perspectives both on individual texts and on larger social and cultural developments. Innovative, authoritative, and comprehensive, The Broadview Anthology of British Literature embodies a consistently fresh approach to the study of literature and literary history. The full Broadview Anthology of British Literature comprises six bound volumes, together with an extensive website component; the latter has been edited, annotated, and designed according to the same high standards as the bound book component of the anthology, and is accessible at www.broadviewpress.com/BABL by using the passcode obtained with the purchase of one or more of the bound volumes. The six individual bound volumes are also available in any combination at special package prices. Highlights of Volume 4: The Age of Romanticism include: Jane Austen&#39;s Lady Susan, a lesser-known but wonderfully readable epistolary short novel; &#34;A Hymn to Na&#39;ra&#39;yena&#34; by Sir William Jones; and, in an exception to the anthology&#39;s general policy of including works in their entirety, Mary Shelley is represented by the last two chapters of The Last Man and by a selection of letters.</p><p>Joseph Black, University of Massachusetts Leonard Conolly, Trent University Kate Flint, Rutgers University Isobel Grundy, University of Alberta Roy Liuzza, University of Tennessee Jerome McGann, University of Virginia Anne Prescott, Barnard College Barry Qualls, Rutgers University Claire Waters, University of California at Davis"With the publication of The Broadview Anthology of British Literature, teachers and students in survey and upper-level undergraduate courses have a compelling alternative to the established anthologies from Norton and Longman. Having adopted the first two volumes for an early period survey course last year, I had no hesitation in repeating the experience this year. The medieval volume, in particular, is superb, with its generous representation of Anglo-Saxon and Anglo-Norman literary culture, as well as its growing collection of texts from the too little-known fifteenth century. This is a very real intellectual, as well as pedagogical, achievement." (Nicholas Watson)<br><br>"From the sample of Old English selections I've read, as well as the full and fascinating table of contents, this reasonably-priced anthology looks like a winner for courses surveying British literature from Caedmon's Hymn to Monty Python's Flying Circus and beyond." (Roberta Frank)<br><br>"Broadview's new anthology is one of the few anthologies to have a good selection of texts that includes both old favorites and lesser-known but still valuable works. It will give instructors a great deal of choice."

Ethics, theory, case conceptualization, treatment planning, decision making, and collaborative empiricism are all included, to enable clinicians to develop individualized treatment plans for the clients sitting across from them.

This book reveals today's most effective persuasion techniques for business professionals. While it focuses on the business arena, these principles of persuasion can easily be successfully applied in your personal life.</p> <p>Though the techniques are similar, Lakhani draws a hard line between persuasion and manipulation, with the primary distinction being intent. True persuasion is based in truth, honesty, inquisitiveness, and the ability to tell a powerful story and to meet the expectations of those you're trying to persuade. Good persuasion is a practiced art&#x2014;a carefully orchestrated dance between you and the person you are persuading.</p> <p>In Persuasion, Lakhani teaches you the steps in that delicate dance, showing you how to apply proven persuasive principles to common business challenges.

It uses hard science to support its theories, citing the opinions of noted neuroscientists, psychologists, and influence professionals and features examples of persuasion at work in sales, copywriting, advertising, negotiations, and personal interactions. It shows you how to persuade your audience in small, simple steps that proceed to the desired result. Because today's prospects are sophisticated and technologically savvy, there's information on tech-savvy persuasion methods for use with Web sites, in blogs or teleseminars, or by Podcasting to a targeted audience. Learn exactly how to get your message through the electronic clutter facing decision makers today.</p> <p>If you've been successful, you've probably intuitively used some of these persuasion techniques before, but this book will mentor you through a dramatic increase in your ability to persuade. Imagine how successful you'll be when you know how to strategically layer on tactic after tactic to methodically and effectively break down natural resistance, increase the emotions of acceptance and desire, and move the prospect to the right outcome&#x2014;the outcome you desire.</p><b>DAVE LAKHANI</b> is the President of Bold Approach, Inc., a business acceleration consultancy.

As a visionary, statesman, and historian, and the most eloquent spokesman against Nazi Germany, Winston Churchill was one of the greatest figures of the twentieth century. In this autobiography, Churchill recalls his childhood, his schooling, his years as a war correspondent in South Africa during the Boer War, and his first forays into politics as a member of Parliament. - Amazon</p><p>The voice of a vanished England speaks from the pages of Winston Churchill's evocative memoir of his first 30 years (1874-1904). The young Churchill inhabits a world in which men fight like hell in meaningless colonial wars--India, Egypt, South Africa--soldiering across the imperial map then extending the hand of friendship to their erstwhile enemy as if they were schoolmates at Harrow. Yet Churchill, born into a privileged family, was not an uncritical supporter of the Victorian status quo. He himself loathed Harrow; an especially amusing chapter skewers the school's emphasis on an irrelevant classical education and rote learning. A firm Tory, he considered himself a friend of the working class, and in 1899 campaigned for parliament with a Socialist colleague. Looking back from his vantage point of 1930, Churchill expresses the most attractive values of the English aristocracy--honor, loyalty, fair play--without giving the impression he wants to live in the past. The book's appeal also stems from its magisterial but colloquial prose. Anyone familiar with recordings of Churchill's rousing speeches during Word War II will hear in their minds' ears that growling timbre and unmistakably patrician accent as they read. Though he would have preferred the peace prize, <i>My Early Life</i> offers good evidence that Churchill's 1953 Nobel for literature was aptly awarded. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>Here, in his own words, are the fascinating first thirty years in the life of one of the most provocative and compelling leaders of the twentieth century - Winston Churchill. As a visionary, statesman, and historian, and the most eloquent spokesman against the Nazi Germany, Winston Churchill was one of the greatest figures of the twentieth century. In this autobiography, Churchill recalls his childhood, his schooling, his years as a war correspondent in South Africa during the Boer War, and his first forays into politics as a member of Parliament. My Early Life not only gives readers insights into the shaping of a great leader but, as Churchill himself wrote, &#34;a picture of a vanished age&#34;.</p><h2>We&#39;re Right, They&#39;re Wrong: A Handbook for Spirited Progressives</h2><p>The campaign strategist for the election of Bill Clinton provides an entertaining and timely response to the Republicans&#39; &#34;Contract with America,&#34; defending a strong government and its social role and providing a definitive program for strengthening America. Original. 150,000 first printing. Tour.</p><p>James Carville, chief strategist of Clinton&#39;s 1992 War Room, puts the Democrats on the offensive again with this no-holds-barred response to the Republican &#34;Contract With America&#34;. Witty, savvy, and just plain smart, this may be the most provocative book of the 1996 campaign season.James Carville, the country's best known and most colorful political consultant, was born on October 25, 1944. He grew up the oldest of eight children in Carville, Louisiana, a one-stop-sign town on the Mississippi River which was named at the turn of the century for his grandfather, the town's postmaster. His father, Chester James Carville, was also a postmaster, as well as the owner of a general store. His mother, named Lucille but known to all as Miss Nippy, successfully sold World Book encyclopedias door-to-door and put all eight of her children through college with the proceeds.<br><br>Carville, who probably has managed more campaigns than any other political consultant in America, got his first job in politics-canvassing for a car dealer running for the Louisiana state legislature-while still a student at Ascension Catholic High School. In 1962 he entered Louisiana State University and-not to put too fine a spin on it-flunked out four years later. To assuage his Catholic guilt, he quickly enlisted in the Marine Corps. After serving for two years, at San Diego's Camp Pendleton, he returned to LSU, finished his undergraduate degree at night, and then, with the financial assistance of an uncle, went on to earn a law degree. Carville was a litigator for a Baton Rouge law firm from 1973 until 1979, but he was never happy working as a lawyer, and as a result he spent much of his free time as a consultant to Democrats running for local and statewide offices. He managed his first campaign, a U.S. Senate race in Virginia, in 1982. The following year, while managing Lloyd Doggett's unsuccessful bid for governor of Texas, he acquired the nickname "Ragin' Cajun" and began his odd-couple professional collaboration with Paul Begala, who had just graduated from the University of Texas. The two teamed up full time in 1989 and formed the Carville &amp; Begala political consulting firm, specializing in strategy, message development, "earned media," and, above all, winning elections for Democrats.<br><br>Carville and Begala's biggest win was Bill Clinton's election to the presidency in 1992, the first time a Democrat had claimed the White House in 12 years. In 1993 Carville was honored as the Campaign Manager of the Year by the American Association of Political Consultants for his leadership of Clinton's fearsome and intense Little Rock campaign headquarters, known as the "War Room." This role also made him the focus, along with George Stephanopoulos, of the feature-length documentary film "<b>The War Room</b>," an Academy Award nominee. He is currently serving as a Senior Political Advisor to the President.<br><br>Carville's long list of electoral successes also includes the 1991 U.S. Senate victory of Harris Wofford over Richard Thornburgh, in Pennsylvania; the 1990 gubernatorial victories of Zell Miller, in Georgia, and Robert P. Casey, in Pennsylvania; the 1988 re-election of Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, in New Jersey; the 1987 gubernatorial victory of Wallace Wilkinson, in Kentucky; and the 1986 gubernatorial victory of Robert Casey, in Pennsylvania.<br><br>Carville is married to Mary Matalin, the deputy campaign manager of George Bush's re-election bid, and now host of CNBC's nightly political talk show "Equal Time" and the daily CBS radio program "The Mary Matalin Show." The couple co-wrote <b>All's Fair: Love, War, and Running for President</b> (Simon &amp; Schuster/ Random House, 1994), one of the best selling campaign memoirs in American history. They had their first child, Matalin Mary Carville, last summer.</p><h2>The Complete Restaurant Management Guide</h2><p>Two highly successful veterans in the restaurant industry offer surefire tips to lower the risks of failure, avoid the common pitfalls, and make day-to-day operations smooth and profitable.

Her first novel, Blackkerchief Dick, was published in 1923 when she was 19. Her first work of detective fiction was a serialized story published by the Daily Express in 1927. Entitled The White Cottage Mystery, it contained atypical themes for a woman writer of the era. Her breakthrough occurred in 1929 with the publication of The Crime at Black Dudley. This introduced Albert Campion, albeit originally as a minor character. He returned in Mystery Mile, thanks in part to pressure from her American publishers, much taken with the character. Campion proved so successful that Allingham made him the centrepiece of another 17 novels and over 20 short stories, continuing into the 1960s.</p><p>&#x201c;A top-notch mystery, full of keen characterization, humor, old English atmosphere, a charmingly decadent family and a few sudden deaths&#x201d; &#x2014; New York Times</p></p><h2>Programming Erlang: Software for a Concurrent World</h2><p><p>Erlang solves one of the most pressing problems facing developers today: how to write reliable, concurrent, high-performance systems. It's used worldwide by companies who need to produce reliable, efficient, and scalable applications. Invest in learning Erlang now.</p><p>Moore's Law is the observation that the amount you can do on a single chip doubles every two years. But Moore's Law is taking a detour. Rather than producing faster and faster processors, companies such as Intel and AMD are producing multi-core devices: single chips containing two, four, or more processors. If your programs aren't concurrent, they'll only run on a single processor at a time. Your users will think that your code is slow.</p><p>Erlang is a programming language designed for building highly parallel, distributed, fault-tolerant systems. It has been used commercially for many years to build massive fault-tolerated systems that run for years with minimal failures.</p><p>Erlang programs run seamlessly on multi-core computers: this means your Erlang program should run a lot faster on a 4 core processor than on a single core processor, all without you having to change a line of code.</p><p>Erlang combines ideas from the world of functional programming with techniques for building fault-tolerant systems to make a powerful language for building the massively parallel, networked applications of the future.</p><p>This book presents Erlang and functional programming in the familiar Pragmatic style.

As Ebert noted in the introduction to the first collection of those pieces, &#x201c;They are not <i>the</i> greatest films of all time, because all lists of great movies are a foolish attempt to codify works which must stand alone. But it&#x2019;s fair to say: If you want to take a tour of the landmarks of the first century of cinema, start here.<br><br>Enter <i>The Great Movies III</i>, Ebert&#x2019;s third collection of essays on the crï¿½me de la crï¿½me of the silver screen, each one a model of critical appreciation and a blend of love and analysis that will send readers back to the films with a fresh set of eyes and renewed enthusiasm&#x2014;or maybe even lead to a first-time viewing. From <i>The Godfather: Part II </i>to <i>Groundhog Day</i>, from <i>The Last Picture Show </i>to <i>Last Tango in Paris</i>, the hundred pieces gathered here display a welcome balance between the familiar and the esoteric, spanning Hollywood blockbusters and hidden gems, independent works and foreign language films alike. Each essay draws on Ebert&#x2019;s vast knowledge of the cinema, its fascinating history, and its breadth of techniques, introducing newcomers to some of the most exceptional movies ever made, while revealing new insights to connoisseurs as well.<br><br>Named the most powerful pundit in America by <i>Forbes</i> magazine, and a winner of the Pulitzer Prize, Roger Ebert is inarguably the most prominent and influential authority on the cinema today. <i>The Great Movies III</i> is sure to please his many fans and further enhance his reputation as America&#x2019;s most respected&#x2014;and trusted&#x2014;film critic.</p></p><p><p></p><b>Roger Ebert</b> is the Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning film critic of the <i>Chicago Sun-Times</i>. He is the author of numerous books on film, including <i>The Great Movies</i>, <i>The Great Movies II</i>, <i>Awake in the Dark: The Best of Roger Ebert</i>, and <i>Scorsese by Ebert</i>, the last two titles published by the University of Chicago Press.<p></p>Ebert, indisputably the nation&#x2019;s most prominent and influential film critic, returns with a third collection of brief essays on 100 movies worthy of further examination. As before, he balances his selection among classics from Hollywood&#x2019;s golden age (Top Hat, The Band Wagon) and modern era (Godfather: Part II, Groundhog Day), silent movies (Phantom of the Opera, Safety Last), foreign masterworks (Fanny and Alexander, Late Spring), and a smattering of documentaries (Crumb) and animation (three Chuck Jones cartoons). In every case, Ebert offers informed critical appraisals, as well as background on the movie&#x2019;s making and significance, that make these pieces rewarding for film buffs and ideal introductions for first-time viewers. Ebert views his role as one of education and enlightenment: Citing readers who accused him of snobbery when he disparaged the Transformers sequel, he wagers in his introduction that no one could start out loving that misbegotten effort, &#x201c;experience the films in this book, and end by loving it.&#x201d; While few might share his belief that today&#x2019;s moviegoers can be steered away from Michael Bay and toward Bï¿½la Tarr, his populist-based optimism is commendable.

Simply stated, this book is an important tool for any clinician who aspires to engage the suicidal mind and clinically venture forth into the world of 'psychache.' This book is good news for the clinician and even better news for the lives of patients this approach will save."--from the Foreword by Edwin S. Shneidman, PhD, University of California, Los Angeles<br><br> "An exemplary treatment guide must combine science, clinical wisdom, and relevant personal experience, and must attend to the sometimes vexing everyday realities of clinicians seeing patients. Who is up to such a daunting task? David A. Jobes, for one. His model, The Collaborative Assessment and Management of Suicidality (CAMS), is the epitome of a science-based, clinician-friendly approach, and his book does CAMS due justice. Readers of this book will be better positioned to understand, assess, and treat suicidal behavior."--Thomas Joiner, PhD, Florida State University<br><br> "It is rare to find a book that is firmly grounded in science and that also offers a flexible, commonsense model for clinical practice. Jobes has given us just such a gem. He provides essential tools for clinicians of every persuasion and level of expertise. This book is ideal for training graduate students or providing an infrastructure to supervision for psychologists, counselors, psychiatrists, social workers, or nurses who have contact with suicidal patients. The book will leave the reader with a newfound sense of confidence that his or her approach is embedded in 'best practices,' has a wealth of empirical support, and is one that patients will respond to in a positive fashion."--M. David Rudd, PhD, Texas Tech University<br><br> "<i>Managing Suicidal Risk </i>effectively meets the critical need for clear guidelines for assessing and treating the suicidal person. In the belief that most suicidal people want to end their pain, not their life, Jobes offers the clinician a comprehensive, multifaceted handbook tailored to present-day treatment realities. This book can serve to guide the clinician in providing the suicide-prone patient with hope and help through a life-threatening crisis. It is well suited for specialized courses in suicide prevention and crisis intervention, and for more general graduate-level courses in mental health counseling and assessment."--Katherine van Wormer, PhD, MSSW, University of Northern Iowa<br><br> "For the last decade, Jobes and his colleagues have been researching and refining their novel therapeutic approach. Jobes offers an antidote to haphazard and personalized views of working with suicidal patients, integrating the theoretical constructs of Edwin Shneidman, Aaron Beck, and Roy Baumeister into a comprehensive and evidence-based treatment strategy. The Collaborative Assessment and Management of Suicidality (CAMS) gives clients leverage to fight for their lives. Every graduate student and clinician working with suicidal patients needs to read this manual and learn this approach."--Morton M. Silverman, MD, Editor-in-Chief, <i>Suicide and Life-Threatening Behavior</i><br><br> "The CAMS approach has quickly achieved best-practice status and, as more clinical trials are completed, is destined to be sufficiently evidence-based to become a 'must' in every clinician&#x2019;s repertoire. This accessible guide teaches clinicians to listen to and align with their patients, to consistently target suicide risk, and to effectively reduce that risk. Jobes is a master teacher, and readers of this book are lucky to be among his students."--Alan L. Berman, PhD, Executive Director, American Association of Suicidology<br><br>"An essential addition to any clinician's repertoire of books, especially for those interested in working with depressed clients. The success of the CAMS framework and what sets it apart from other treatment approaches is the emphasis placed on understanding the broader, underlying issues at the core of the suicidal patient. Jobes provides an alternative approach instead of the traditional focus on suicidal ideation as a symptom of a broader psychopathology. Moreover, it is clear that Jobes speaks from a scientist-practitioner perspective as evidenced by his extensive knowledge and activity in suicide research as well as by his personal case examples. Jobes successfully provides the clinician with the light needed to help those individuals who have been trapped by the darkness of suicide."

Speakers can forget words, phrases, even entire languages they once knew; over the course of time peoples, too, let go of the tongues that were once theirs, as languages disappear and give way to the others that follow them. In <i>Echolalias</i>, Daniel Heller-Roazen reflects on the many forms of linguistic forgetfulness, offering a far-reaching philosophical investigation into the persistence and disappearance of speech. In twenty-one brief chapters, he moves among classical, medieval, and modern culture, exploring the interrelations of speech, writing, memory, and oblivion.</p><p>Drawing his examples from literature, philosophy, linguistics, theology, and psychoanalysis, Heller-Roazen examines the points at which the transience of speech has become a question in the arts, disciplines, and sciences in which language plays a prominent role. Whether the subject is Ovid, Dante, or modern fiction, classical Arabic literature or the birth of the French language, structuralist linguistics or Freud's writings on aphasia, Heller-Roazen considers with clarity, precision, and insight the forms, the effects, and the ultimate consequences of the forgetting of language. In speech, he argues, destruction and construction often prove inseparable. Among peoples, the disappearance of one language can mark the emergence of another; among individuals, the experience of the passing of speech can lie at the origin of literary, philosophical, and artistic creation.</p><p>From the infant's prattle to the legacy of Babel, from the holy tongues of Judaism and Islam to the concept of the dead language and the political significance of exiled and endangered languages today, <i>Echolalias</i> traces an elegant, erudite, and original philosophical itinerary, inviting us to reflect in a new way on the nature of the speaking animal who forgets.</p></p><p>"If there ever was a book like this one, I cannot remember it. Heller-Roazen&#x2019;s gorgeous prose strings beads of dazzling example into a necklace of allusion. When have such important philosophical and philological arguments about the nature of language and such trenchant critiques been made with such graceful learning? With each turn of the page we pass from amnesia to anamnesis and back again. When we come to the end we awaken, like Circe&#x2019;s pigs, filled with regret that that adventure is over, but filled also with a new wonder about human language, from its most humble letters to the heights of poetry. If you read this book, you will not easily forget it." <p>David Nirenberg, author of <i>Communities of Violence: Persecution of Minorities in the Middle Ages</i> </p><p>"Reading Daniel Heller-Roazen&#x2019;s book is an extraordinary intellectual adventure. Vertiginous landscapes of learning open up at every moment, but the writing never loses its aphoristic edge. Much is said and even more is suggested. This book rebuilds whole worlds from the ravages of loss and forgetting, and also discreetly teaches us that there are no worlds that loss and forgetting do not beset." </p><p>Michael Wood, author of <i>The Road to Delphi</i> </p><p>"Daniel Heller-Roazen has written a magical and learned story of language. Here the life and death and never-ending mutability of languages, the babbling lost in the interstices of speech, the history of typographical marks, the mysteries of animals sounds and speech disorders, forgotten tongues and mother tongues, linguistic paradoxes and tragedies all acquire a brilliant and Ovidian intensity." </p><p>Susan Stewart, author of <i>Columbarium</i> and <i>Poetry and the Fate of the Senses</i></p>Daniel Heller-Roazen is the Arthur W.

But many of us may not realize that what we now call snail mail was once just as revolutionary. As David M. Henkin argues in <i>The Postal Age</i>, a burgeoning postal network initiated major cultural shifts during the nineteenth century, laying the foundation for the interconnectedness that now defines our ever-evolving world of telecommunications. <br> <br> This fascinating history traces these shifts from their beginnings in the mid-1800s, when cheaper postage, mass literacy, and migration combined to make the long-established postal service a more integral and viable part of everyday life. With such dramatic events as the Civil War and the gold rush underscoring the importance and necessity of the post, a surprisingly broad range of Americans&#x2014;male and female, black and white, native-born and immigrant&#x2014;joined this postal network, regularly interacting with distant locales before the existence of telephones or even the widespread use of telegraphy. Drawing on original letters and diaries from the period, as well as public discussions of the expanding postal system, Henkin tells the story of how these Americans adjusted to a new world of long-distance correspondence, crowded post offices, junk mail, valentines, and dead letters.<br> <br> <i>The Postal Age</i> paints a vibrant picture of a society where possibilities proliferated for the kinds of personal and impersonal communications that we often associate with more recent historical periods. In doing so, it significantly increases our understanding of both antebellum America and our own chapter in the history of communications.<br> <br></p> <p></p> <p></p></p><p><b>David M. Henkin</b> is associate professor of history at the University of California, Berkeley. He is the author of<i>City Reading</i>."For the first half century of [the U.S. Postal Service's] founding, its main function was to circulate newspapers to a national audience. . . . That all changed in 1845 when Congress enacted the first in a series of laws that sharply reduced the cost of sending letters. The new rates led to a vast surge in personal correspondence. They set up a communications revolution that the historian David Henkin has chronicled in an engaging new book called <i>The Postal Age</i>." (Geoff Nunberg <i>Fresh Air</i>)<br><br>"Henkin's is that rare book suitable for undergraduates, instructive to graduate students, and useful for any scholar of nineteenth-century America. . . . Ultimately, Henkin has written an original, ambitious, compelling, and elegant book that should spur greater scholarly attention to the history of communications in nineteenth-century America." (Konstantin Dierks <i>Journal of the Early Republic</i>)<br><br>"This rich study is well referenced. . . . Highly recommended." (<i>Choice</i>)<br><br>"Henkin is something of a model for at once taking seriously and moving beyond his theoretical sources; by engaging the complex particulars of the past, he produces a more compelling account of the making and remaking of American public life. . . .&nbsp;&nbsp;What Henkin is in the process of achieving&#x2014;with <i>City Reading</i> and <i>The Postal Age</i> as the first two parts&#x2014;is a thoroughgoing reimagining of the inner worlds of antebellum Americans. . . . Like Tocqueville, Henkin manages to suggest a proper note of awe in the face of the communications revolution of the middle of the nineteenth century.

(David Quigley <i>Reviews in American History</i>)<br><br>"Here is a postal culture that will seem all too familiar to modern readers. Here are the real roots of our interconnected age." (Robert MacDougall <i>Business History Review</i>)<br><br>"<i>The Postal Age </i>develops a strong case for studying the developmental interplay of communication technologies, publics, and practices of reading, seeing, and writing as constitutive of self, other, and nation. . . .&nbsp;By sensitively addressing the cultural implications of changing patterns of participation and use of mail exchange, [the book] advances scholarship on the role of the post in everyday life."<p></p> (Derek W. Valliant <i>New England Quarterly</i>)<br><br>"Henkin's engaging, well-written book ought to receive a wide readership. . . . He shows that today's expectations of ubiquitous and instant accessibility have their social and cultural roots in the nineteenth-century post office. Similarly, Henkin reminds us that advances in the speed and reliability of communications often occur through political will and administrative initiatives, with no new technological innovations. Finally, Henkin provides a valuable model for understanding the social and cultural history of a new communications medium, by explaining how individuals encountered, understood, and wove it into the fabric of their lives."

John, author of Spreading the News: The American Postal System from F)<br><br><p>&#x201c;David Henkin&#x2019;s <i>The Postal Age</i> is a brilliant successor to his earlier <i>City Reading</i>, and continues his insightful investigations of communications and social life. <i>The Postal Age</i> is engagingly written, rich with anecdotes and observations that dramatize and illuminate the manifold facets of 'postal culture' in the antebellum United States. Americans took advantage of a growing and increasingly accessible postal system to exchange money, news, seeds, daguerreotypes, love letters, and anonymous valentines (not to mention the earliest forms of spam and junk mail), transforming courtship, commerce, and civic life. At every stage, Henkin avoids the temptations of crass determinism to offer a nuanced view of the complicated relationships between technologies and systems and social forms. <i>The Postal Age</i> is a major contribution to American social history and to the history of communications in general.&#x201d;Going Nucular: Language, Politics, and Culture in Controversial Times&gt;</p> (Nunberg, author of Going Nucular: Language, Politics, and Culture in Controversi)</p><h2>Architecture and Construction: Building Pyramids, Log Cabins, Castles, Igloos, Bridges, and Skyscrapers (Scholastic Voyages of Discovery) (Scholastic Voyages of Discovery.

He not only describes and recommends new methods for notating modern music, thereby establishing standard procedures for the present and future, but integrates them with traditional practices still in use. The result is a guide to all forms of notation used in serious music today.</strong></p> Stone is undoubtedly one of the world's leading authorities on contemporary music notation and its problems. As head of the Index of New Musical Notation, he collected and categorized the myriad new devices appearing in published music of this century. In collaboration with professional performers and conductors, he evaluated these devices in order to determine their effectiveness in practical application. At the International Conference on New Music Notation 1974, a consensus was sought from the eighty participating musicians from eighteen different countries. The results have been incorporated into this volume in the clearest and most direct way. Traditional notation is given detailed treatment, constituting, as it does, the basis for many of the innovative devices. The book is organized to facilitate the location of specific information and for easy reference. A minutely detailed index is provided as an additional and indispensable tool.</p><p></p><h2>Loose Change: Three Women of the Sixties</h2><p>This is a compelling story of the experiences of three young women who attended the University of California at Berkeley and became caught up in the tumultuous changes of the Sixties. Sara Davidson follows the three&#x2015;Susie, Tasha, and Sara herself&#x2015;from their first meeting in 1962, through the events that "radicalized" them in unexpected ways in the decade after the years in Berkeley. Susie navigates through the Free Speech Movement and the early women's movement in Berkeley, and Tasha enters the trendy New York art and society scene. Sara, a journalist, travels the country reporting on the stories of the sixties.<br><br>The private lives that Davidson reconstructs are set against the public background of the time. Figures such as Timothy Leary, Mario Savio, Tom Hayden, and Joan Baez are here, as are the many young people who sought alternatives to "the establishment" through whatever means seemed worth exploring: radical politics, meditation, drugs, group sex, or dropping out. Davidson's honest and detailed chronicle reveals the hopes, confusion, and disillusionment of a generation whose rites of passage defined one of the most contentious decades of this century.</p><p>"The book is witty, sad, incisive, and totally clean of sociological cant or the pomposities of a certain kind of generalizing journalism. . . .

The baptism with the Holy Spirit: what it is and what it does</p><p>2. The necessity and possibility of the baptism with the Holy Spirit</p><p>3. How this experience can be obtained</p><p>4. Re-filling with the Holy Spirit</p><p>5. How spiritual power is lost</p><p>Torrey states further: "It was a great turning point in my ministry when after much thought and study and meditation I became satisfied that the baptism with the Holy Spirit was an experience for today and for me, and set myself to obtain it.</p><p>"While a great deal is said in these days concerning the baptism with the Holy Spirit, I am afraid that there are many who talk about it and pray for it who have no clear and definite idea if what it is.

Three themes intersect and inform chapter discussions: developing a critical reflexivity, understanding the distance dynamic and engaging in respectful research praxis. The text illustrates how power, privilege and passion influence decisions about what gets researched, who is positioned as researcher or participant and how data are collected, analyzed and ultimately represented in public ways. </p><p>Tilley explores the intersecting elements of the research process, which include deciding on a research focus and articulating research questions; choosing an appropriate research site and participants; collecting, analyzing and representing data; and making decisions about the dissemination and publication of findings. She emphasizes the dilemmas researchers experience when faced with issues of respectful representation of data, participants and research contexts. Unique to the book are the comprehensive discussions of the advisement process and the student-advisor relationship and Tilley&#x2019;s use of her doctoral research to illustrate elements of the research process. Each chapter ends with an annotated bibliography of relevant research connected to concepts addressed in the chapter. </p><p>Tilley offers a comprehensive consideration of research ethics, including guidance for the completion of institutional requirements for ethics review of research involving human participants and an exploration of the complex ethical issues that emerge during the research process.</p><p>Doing Respectful Research is written for student researchers, individuals who teach and advise students, instructors of qualitative research courses in social sciences, health and education, and community members interested in qualitative methods and conducting research.</p></p><p>Susan A.

They examine the myths--like our belief that modern man lives longer than his ancestors did--and the images, both visual and verbal, that have been created to represent that which we shall all become.<br> Full of surprising and fascinating facts about old age and the literature and art it has inspired, <em>A History of Old Age</em> provides a welcome and refreshing look at what the subject has meant to the Greeks and the Romans, medieval men and women, the Romantics, and the modern men and women of rootless, urban societies. Opulently and ingeniously illustrated with reproductions drawn from this astonishingly wide range of eras and media, it offers reassurance as it brings to light the strength and nobility so many writers and artists have found in the elderly. It is an uplifting companion for those who, like it or not, are beginning to understand the inevitability of their own aging process.</p><p><br><strong>Pat Thane</strong> is deputy director of the Institute of Historical Research, London; <strong>Tim Parkin</strong> is professor of classics, University of Canterbury; <strong>Shulamith Shahar</strong> is professor emeritus, Tel Aviv University; <strong>Marcia Pointon</strong> is professor emerita and former Chair, School of History and Architecture, University of Manchester; <strong>Thomas Cole</strong> is professor at the University of Texas; and <strong>Deborah Cherry</strong> is professor of the history of art at Sussex University.<br></p><h2>Beyond the Basics: German (Coursebook) (Complete Basic Courses)</h2><p>Our best-selling language series just went <i>Beyond the Basics</i>!<br><br>Now there&#x2019;s a fantastic new way for language learners to take their German to the next level and go <i>Beyond the Basics</i>!

It provides readers with a complete understanding of political ideologies and <i>how these concepts relate to their own lives. </i>New problems that demand solutions have arisen, and we need a firm understanding of our values and the political system under which we live. <b> </b>Covers ideologies, political attitudes, nationalism, democratic theory, capitalism, the democratic process, anarchism, socialist theory, applied socialism, facism, feminism, ecologism, and environmentalism.<b> </b>An excellent reference work for anyone involved in international relations or politics and policy.</p></p><p>Ideal for majors and non-majors alike, this text provides a comprehensive, chronological survey of the most important political ideologies -- within the context of significant social, economic, political, technological, historical, and contemporary events. It prepares students to understand and relate the various political ideologies to the general political values of the left, the mainstream, and the right -- as they appear in contemporary political events and issues -- and to see clearly how political theory applies to their own lives.Preface <p> Since the first edition of this book, we have witnessed many changes in the tides of world political turmoil. The Cold War ended and much of the communist world collapsed. People were hopeful momentarily that the political climate would grow more temperate and tensions relax. However, although the frightening possibility of a nuclear confrontation between the superpowers has diminished, we still find ourselves confronted with a threatening environment. The Middle East continues to fester; religious fundamentalism engenders violence; political terrorism continues to threaten disruption; racism divides peoples against themselves; nationalism and neo-fascism emerge again, creating havoc and motivating paranoid Americans to join militant citizen militias in efforts to protect themselves from imagined adversity; famine emaciates millions in the developing world; air pollution is almost inescapable; water everywhere is increasingly adulterated; the earth's protective layer of ozone is rapidly disintegrating; the globe is warming in response to the chemicals released into the atmosphere; and the press of the world's population on available food supplies and other resources is now dangerously acute. </p><p> These problems, and many others demanding solutions, confront us and our political leaders. To resolve our difficulties, we realize that we must work together with other people in the world, since many of our problems traverse national boundaries and exceed the capacity of single states to successfully address them. In order to cooperate in the salvation of humankind, we must learn to deal with people who have values, biases, views, and ideas that are different from our own. Hence, we must confront a number of basic questions if we hope to successfully meet the challenges of the first few years of the twenty-first century. What, for example, are the fundamental concepts in modern politics? What ideas serve as the foundation of our political system? How does our system differ from others? What is socialism, and how does it relate to democracy and to communism? Is fascism moribund, or does it survive, awaiting another chance to take hold in a society confused and disoriented by the complexities of modern life? Why don't people of the world see things our way? How do they view the world, and why do they value the things they do? What are their assumptions and objectives? And, perhaps most important, What do 1 believe and how do my views relate to the politics of my time? These and hundreds of other questions must be addressed if we are to face intelligently the political controversies that loom before us. </p><p> Traditionally, the American people have been impatient with theoretical concepts. Finding such notions abstract and uninteresting, they prefer more tangible, practical approaches to politics. Moreover, the American political tack has usually been unilateral. We have either tried to ignore the rest of the world&#x2014;as in much of the early part of this century&#x2014;or we have expected the world to conform to our attitudes and policies&#x2014;as has been the case since World War II. But such a narrow view is no longer viable&#x2014;if indeed it ever was. The United States must face the fact that it is only one player, albeit an important one, in global politics, and we must learn to cooperate with the rest of the world in the resolution of common problems. To do so, we must understand the other peoples of the world. We must comprehend their needs, their ideals, their values, their views. In this endeavor, there can be no better place to start than by coming to appreciate their political ideologies. A clear understanding of the current ideologies in the world is essential if one is to grasp the political realities of our time. A NOTE TO THE STUDENT </p><p> I think of myself as a teacher, not an author. This book, therefore, is written as a vehicle for teaching some of the world's great ideas, and as such it reaches students whom the author will probably never meet and thus influences the lives of strangers, if only slightly. With pedagogy in mind, several features have been incorporated in this book that will help the reader learn its contents more easily. </p><p> Each chapter is preceded by a preview of the material to be covered in that chapter. The preview is designed to alert students to the principal ideas developed in the text that follows. Thus you will find that, equipped with this overview, the details in the chapter become more meaningful. It may be wise to reread the previews after you finish each chapter. That way you can check your comprehension of the material. At the end of each chapter, questions are provided that are designed to stimulate thought and discussion about the major themes in the chapter. </p><p> I have also included at the end of the chapters a brief bibliography of books that can be used in further pursuit of the subject. These lists are certainly not exhaustive of the subjects they address, but they can be used as jumping-off places for more detailed inquiry into the subject. </p><p> The text also includes italicized words and phrases. When encountering these words, take special note of them; it is my way of saying that material is particularly important. The glossary and the index at the end of the book should also be especially useful. In addition, the names and concepts appearing in boldface in the text can be found among the items in the glossary, and you should pay close attention to them as well. </p><p> As a final note to the reader, I would like to say just a few words about general education requirements. Responding to economic and social pressures, students today are understandably anxious to complete their studies so that they can begin to make a living. Courses that do not immediately translate into dollars are often viewed by students as superfluous impositions on their time. The course for which you are reading this text may be one of those offerings. Yet, there is more to life than materialism, and we must learn to appreciate and enjoy what we are and who we are while we make a living. In fact, it is likely that we will make a better living, or at least live better, if we appreciate and understand the world in which we live. </p><p> Education is the custodian of civilization. Its function is to transmit the knowledge of our civilization to each succeeding generation. General education courses are the principal vehicle by which this function is executed at the college level. They offer you the priceless treasure of society's wisdom. Immerse yourself in them, savor them, absorb them, enjoy them. Let general education courses expose you to the wonders of our world, expanding your vision and deepening your appreciation of life so that, as Stephen Bailey wrote, "Later in life when you knock on yourself, someone answers." ACKNOWLEDGMENTS </p><p> While any inaccuracies in this book are completely my own responsibility, several people have made such substantial contributions to this work that I take pleasure in mentioning them here. My deepest gratitude belongs to my wife, Elaine. Her unselfish help and her unfailing support over the years have been instrumental to the book's success. I am also indebted to our sons Leon and Renï¿½ who, in the early editions of the book, sacrificed time we might have spent together, so that the book could be written. </p><p> For the lucidity the first edition enjoyed, all credit and many thanks go to Professor Julie Hatoff. Spending untold hours reviewing the manuscript, suggesting improvements, and correcting errors, Professor Hatoff was of invaluable assistance. Her conscientious attention to my misplaced modifiers, arbitrary punctuation, and eccentric spelling was very helpful, and I am most grateful to her. I am also very grateful to Professor Richard Leitch of Gustavus Adolphus College and to my colleague and friend David Ballard for their help on this edition. Additionally, I am indebted to the staff at the MiraCosta College Learning Resource Center, including Janet Megill, Patricia McClure, and Marion Forester. Their friendly and helpful attitude makes my work much easier. I would also like to thank Beth Ann Gillett of Prentice Hall. My thanks also to the reviewers, Andrew L. Aoki, Augsburg College; Lyman H. Heine, Fresno State University; John Gerring, Boston University; Michael Hoover, Seminole Community College; Vendulka Kubalkova, University of Miami; Arnold J. Oliver, Heidelberg College; R. Mark Tiller, Houston Community College; and Bruce Tuttle, Fresno State University, for their many helpful suggestions. </p><p> Besides those who did so much to make this book a reality, I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to the people of California for providing an excellent and free public education system to its youth. Were it not for the opportunity to attend state-supported schools and colleges, I would almost surely not have received an education. In addition, I would like to single out three teachers who have had particular influence on my professional life and whose pedagogical and scholarly examples have been important inspirations. To N.

Drawing on unexplored archives and personal testimonies gathered from across Russia and Georgia, this is the first full-scale biography of the Soviet dictator in twenty years.</p><p>Service describes in unprecedented detail the first half of Stalin's life--his childhood in Georgia as the son of a violent, drunkard father and a devoted mother; his education and religious training; and his political activity as a young revolutionary. No mere messenger for Lenin, Stalin was a prominent activist long before the Russian Revolution. Equally compelling is the depiction of Stalin as Soviet leader. Service recasts the image of Stalin as unimpeded despot; his control was not limitless. And his conviction that enemies surrounded him was not entirely unfounded.</p><p>Stalin was not just a vengeful dictator but also a man fascinated by ideas and a voracious reader of Marxist doctrine and Russian and Georgian literature as well as an internationalist committed to seeing Russia assume a powerful role on the world stage. In examining the multidimensional legacy of Stalin, Service helps explain why later would-be reformers--such as Khrushchev and Gorbachev--found the Stalinist legacy surprisingly hard to dislodge. </p><p>Rather than diminishing the horrors of Stalinism, this is an account all the more disturbing for presenting a believable human portrait. Service's lifetime engagement with Soviet Russia has resulted in the most comprehensive and compelling portrayal of Stalin to date.</p></p><p>Robert Service is a Fellow of the British Academy and Professor of Russian History at Oxford University.Here is a life-and-times biography in the grand style: deeply researched, well written, brimming with interpretations. Oxford historian Service, author of an acclaimed biography of Lenin, provides the most complete portrait available of the Soviet ruler, from his early, troubled years in a small town in Georgia to the pinnacle of power in the Kremlin. Most previous biographers have depicted Stalin as a plodding figure whose only distinguishing characteristic was brutality. But Service describes a man who was intelligent and hardworking, who learned from experience and who played an important role in the Russian revolutionary movement...By providing such a rich and complex portrait of the dictator and the Soviet system, Service humanizes Stalin without ever diminishing the extent of the atrocities he unleashed upon the Soviet population. (<i>Publishers Weekly</i> 2005-02-21)<br><br>For an understanding of Stalin the man, the leader, the Georgian, the Russian nationalist, the revolutionary, the party politician, the mass murderer and the international statesman, and his place in modern Russian history--Robert Service's book is unsurpassed. (Harold Shukman, author of <i>Stalin's Generals</i>)<br><br>[A] profound and readable assessment of the Soviet dictator.... Service paints a picture of a ruthless man absorbed in the pursuit of politics, widely read, perceptive, cunning and, despite a self-effacing and isolated persona, the stuff of leadership. (Richard Overy, The Mail on Sunday)<br><br>Service revises every dimension of this multidimensional titan. His book emphasizes the importance of Marxist ideology, economics and Bolshevik culture. But it also rightly presents a human Stalin ... Gritty and unshowy, but enlightened by Service's compelling characterization, magisterial analysis and dry wit, this outstanding biography of lightly worn authority, wide research and superb intuition will be read for decades. (Simon Sebag Montefiore, author of <i>Stalin: The Court of the Red Tsar</i>)<br><br>Robert Service's brilliant biography of Stalin is a major work: the fruit of long research, profound insight and understanding of his subject. It offers a truly rounded and thoroughly readable portrait of this monstrous figure. (Andrew Roberts, Daily Telegraph)<br><br>This is effectively the first full biography since perestroika to encompass the economic, political, diplomatic, military, administrative and, above all, ideological dimensions, as well as the personal aspects of Stalin's colossal life. Gritty and unshowy, but enlightened by Service's compelling characterisation, magisterial analysis and dry wit, this outstanding biography of lightly worn authority, wide research and superb intuition will be read for decades. (Simon Sebag Montefiore <i>Sunday Times</i> 2004-10-10)<br><br>A profound and readable reassessment of the Soviet dictator...Service paints a picture of a ruthless man absorbed in the pursuit of politics, widely read, perceptive, cunning and, despite a self-effacing and isolated persona, the stuff of leadership...Stalin was no fool; he could scarcely have become dictator of a vast nation if he had been. Yet his contemporaries, and many historians since, have underestimated him. Service makes sense of Stalin's achievements by making us take him seriously...Stalin's power at its peak was immense and daunting. Service reminds us that a quarter of Russians recently polled put the Stalin years top of the list of periods in Russian history they most admired...This shrewd biography helps us understand clearly and dispassionately why not everyone remembers Stalin as a murderous ogre. (Richard Overy <i>The Mail on Sunday</i> 2004-10-31)<br><br>Service triumphs in portraying Stalin's personality in the context of his times...This book is a tour de force. Not only does Service trace Stalin's road to dictatorship, he shows us what he did with absolute power...No one has shown in more convincing detail than Service Stalin's evolution to the absolute power that corrupts absolutely. It is, above all, a balanced account. He has the courage to confess that the monster, in his shabby clothes and wornout boots, dying alone in his dacha, soaked in his own urine, remains for him an enigma, not least because of the tyrant's consistent massaging of his own image. (Raymond Carr <i>The Spectator</i> 2004-12-04)<br><br>In his new biography of the Soviet dictator, Robert Service has given the most convincing description yet of how Stalin's insecure Georgian childhood fashioned his psychology. At key points in the book, we are reminded of Stalin's duality--on the one hand he was a proud Caucasian toughie who organized bank robberies and could drink spirits all night. On the other, he was a man who aspired to understand and interpret (crassly) high art and politics...This is the first serious political biography of Stalin since the opening of the archives in Moscow and St. Petersburg in the 1990s and Service has made good use of them. (Misha Glenny <i>Irish Times</i> 2004-11-27)<br><br>In Service's eyes, Stalin remains ruthless, cunning and murderous. But a richer and more complex individual emerges--and a more human one. Stalin is shown as lover, husband and father. A man who wrote poetry and loved singing. A serious communist political thinker and the best-read Russian leader since Catherine the Great...[Service] has written a masterly book, with great erudition, style and wit. Although there are still some Soviet-era archives that remain closed, this biography will surely stand the test of time.

After the last rescue was completed, a new worry arose&#x2014;that New Orleans&#x2019;s unique historic fabric sat in ruins, and we had lost one of the most charming old cities of the New World.<br> <br> In <i>Patina</i>, anthropologist Shannon Lee Dawdy examines what was lost and found through the destruction of Hurricane Katrina. Tracking the rich history and unique physicality of New Orleans, she explains how it came to adopt the nickname &#x201c;the antique city.&#x201d; With innovative applications of thing theory, <i>Patina</i> studies the influence of specific items&#x2014;such as souvenirs, heirlooms, and Hurricane Katrina ruins&#x2014;to explore how the city&#x2019;s residents use material objects to comprehend time, history, and their connection to one another. A leading figure in archaeology of the contemporary, Dawdy draws on material evidence, archival and literary texts, and dozens of post-Katrina interviews to explore how the patina aesthetic informs a trenchant political critique. An intriguing study of the power of everyday objects, <i>Patina</i> demonstrates how sharing in the care of a historic landscape can unite a city&#x2019;s population&#x2014;despite extreme divisions of class and race&#x2014;and inspire civil camaraderie based on a nostalgia that offers not a return to the past but an alternative future.</p></p><p><b>Shannon Lee Dawdy </b>is associate professor of anthropology at the University of Chicago. She was awarded a MacArthur Genius Fellowship in 2010.<br>&#x201c;<i>Patina </i>is a wonderfully original and inspiring piece of work, which challenges the conventional approaches of archaeology, anthropology, and history. Dawdy succeeds in capturing the memory of an extraordinary place that encapsulates many contradictions and tensions within American identity: the city of New Orleans. With this book, Dawdy offers a major contribution to the growing theoretical foundations of this alternative approach of the past; which acknowledges the present to be the only point where from the past can be accurately explored and understood. <i>Patina </i>is a milestone in the new academic focus on historical thought&#x2014;a pioneer work which will set the bar for future specialists in this growing field.&#x201d; (<i>Laurent Olivier, National Archaeological Museum of Saint-Germain-en-Laye</i>)<br><br>"Taking New Orleans and the legacy of Katrina as its center,&nbsp;this book&nbsp;bridges several disciplines: archaeology, cultural heritage and tourism, anthropology, and social theory are all involved to develop Dawdy's construction of "patina." There is much here on the urban archaeology of New Orleans and on local understandings of the material residue of the city's past, but the real focus is social theory and, specifically, how to understand the power of objects in peoples' lives. Even while taking theory as a focus, the writing is clear, and the extensive examples Dawdy draws from both local archaeology and interviews to help anchor the argument in the material world. It will appeal to archaeologists and anthropologists at the graduate and professional levels, and would be suitable for undergraduates with a bit of grounding in those fields."

But at a moment when so much archaeological thinking is dead in the water, it is a straw in the wind suggesting that the new, vital, cross-disciplinary contributions that have started to condense in one disciplinary subfield &#x2013; contemporary archaeology &#x2013; are reaching a new velocity.&nbsp;Her &#x2018;unapologetically humanist&#x2019; approach to natural disaster, physical heritage, material things and the profane strata of contemporary life means that Patina is not only a landmark volume for anthropological archaeology, historic preservation and material culture studies, but also a welcome antidote to the tired trope of ruination." (<i>Sculpture Journal</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Dawdy&#x2019;s <i>Patina</i> is a book that creates concepts. Bringing historical archaeology into conversation with anthropology, this brilliant book provides a beautifully authored, nuanced, and detailed ethnographic account of the layers of human and non-human entanglement that make up the space-time of both pre- and post-Katrina New Orleans. Dawdy&#x2019;s archaeo-anthropological query excavates not only material objects, but also concepts out of this city&#x2019;s layers of built and destroyed environment. In the process, her book transforms New Orleans into an urban space-time generative of ideas that I am certain will be of great comparative interest further afield.&#x201d; (<i>Yael Navaro, University of Cambridge</i>)<br><br><i>&#x201c;Patina </i>draws the reader in and doesn&#x2019;t let go. At once evocative and analytical, this book operates at two deftly interwoven levels, as both a portrait of the city of New Orleans told through its material culture and a provocative theoretical argument. <i>Patina </i>is refreshingly free of academic clutter but richly patinated with layers of subtle thought. Historical archaeology will never be the same after it.&#x201d; (<i>Mary Weismantel, Northwestern University</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Dawdy&#x2019;s vivid and original book&nbsp;provides new ways of understanding the connections between aesthetics, time, and late modern social worlds. Richly grounded both in both its empirical and philosophical material, <i>Patina</i> can be read simultaneously as a social and political critique of late capitalism and a call for a new kind of archaeology which is attentive not only to deep pasts, but to the ways in which they intervene and surface in the present. Dawdy's&nbsp;powerful vision of a profane archaeological methodology will resonate strongly&nbsp;across the humanities and social sciences.&#x201d; (<i>Rodney Harrison, UCL Institute of Archaeology</i>)<br><br>"Absences have often been overlooked by archaeologists in their focus on what has been preserved. But in <i>Patina</i>&nbsp;Dawdy puts due attention on patina (indicating loss and pastness), storytelling (bringing the past to life), fakes and invented traditions (pasts made-up), and even ghosts (haunted sites and buildings)... This past is never really past but very present indeed&#x2014;so Dawdy discusses in some detail how New Orleans was made old in subsequent presents and how Katrina ruined some of that antiquity...

This &#x201c;mediational&#x201d; epistemology&#x2015;internal ideas mediating external reality&#x2015;continues to exert a grip on Western thought, and even philosophers such as Quine, Rorty, and Davidson who have claimed to refute Descartes remain imprisoned within its regime. As Hubert Dreyfus and Charles Taylor show, knowledge consists of much more than the explicit representations we formulate. We gain knowledge of the world through bodily engagement with it&#x2015;by handling things, moving among them, responding to them&#x2015;and these forms of knowing cannot be understood in mediational terms. Dreyfus and Taylor also contest Descartes&#x2019;s privileging of the individual mind, arguing that much of our understanding of the world is necessarily shared.</p><p>Once we deconstruct Cartesian mediationalism, the problems that Hume, Kant, and many of our contemporaries still struggle with&#x2015;trying to prove the existence of objects beyond our representations&#x2015;fall away, as does the motivation for nonrealist doctrines. We can then begin to describe the background everyday world we are absorbed in and the universe of natural kinds discovered by science.</p></p><p><p>Hubert Dreyfus is Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at the University of California, Berkeley.</p><p>Charles Taylor is Professor Emeritus in the Department of Philosophy at McGill University and author of influential books including <i>Sources of the Self, The Ethics of Authenticity,</i> and <i>A Secular Age</i>.

Rauch explores how the system for producing knowledge works in a liberal society, and why it has now become the object of a powerful ideological attack. Moving beyond the First Amendment, he defends the morality, rather than the legality, of an intellectual regime that relies on unfettered and often hurtful criticism. <i>Kindly Inquisitors</i> is a refreshing and vibrant essay, casting a provocative light on the raging debates over political correctness and multiculturalism.<br><br>"Fiercely argued. . . . What sets his study apart is his attempt to situate recent developments in a long-range historical perspective and to defend the system of free intellectual inquiry as a socially productive method of channeling prejudice."&#x2014;Michiko Kakutani, <i>New York Times</i><br><br>"Like no other, this book restates the core of our freedom and demonstrates how great, and disregarded, the peril to that freedom has become."&#x2014;Joseph Coates, <i>Chicago Tribune</i><br><br>"The philosophical defense of free speech and free thought that seems to have been forgotten. . . . A powerful argument."&#x2014;Diane Ravitch, <i>Wall Street Journal</i></p><p><b>Jonathan Rauch</b> is a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution, a contributing editor of the <i>Atlantic</i> and <i>National Journal</i>, and the author of six books, including <i>Government&#x2019;s End</i> and <i>Gay Marriage: Why It Is Good for Gays, Good for Straights, and Good for America.</i>A compelling defense of free speech against its new enemies, who range from the mosques of Iran to the groves of American academe. In place of Justice Holmes's old standard of truth competing in ``the marketplace of ideas,'' Rauch (The Outnation, 1992--not reviewed; contributing editor to National Journal) substitutes a new one: that of ``liberal science.'' Formulated by skeptical epistemologists like Hume and Locke in reaction to the authoritarian regulation of knowledge advocated by Plato, liberal science sorts through the hurly-burly of conflicting claims of truth, marginalizing those that cannot pass scrutiny while accepting that even today's accepted truth may need to be revised tomorrow. But after years of nurturing the spirit of intellectual freedom and the pursuit of knowledge, this principle recently has been shaken, with the defining moment being Western governments' weak-kneed reaction to the 1989 death threat made by the Ayatollah Khomeini against Salman Rushdie. Rauch divides challengers to free speech into three camps: ``fundamentalists,'' who believe truth is obvious and not to be questioned; ``egalitarians,'' who think that the beliefs of all sincere people deserve equal respect; and ``humanitarians,'' who hold that one must never offend. But whether they are Moslems enraged at negative portrayals of Islam, creationists pressing to have their theory taught along with evolution, or minorities imposing university codes against ``hate speech,'' all these groups wish to revive the Inquisition notion that ``people who hold wrong and hurtful opinions should be punished for the good of society.'' Rauch's strength here lies in his relentless insistence that liberal science, though hurtful at times, is the best means of advancing knowledge and avoiding ``herdthink.'' Rauch, Jewish and gay, calls not just for toleration but for ``the hard self-discipline which requires us to live with offense.'' A powerful salvo in the war over political correctness--and a ringing reaffirmation of the principles of free thought as conceived by Locke, John Stuart Mill, and others. -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

By the author of The Corpse Had a Familiar Face. Reprint.</p><p>7 1.5-hour cassettesSlightly blurred carbon copy of The Corpse Had a Familiar Face, Buchanan's riveting 1987 report on crimes she'd covered during her nearly 20 years as a Pulitzer-winning reporter for The Miami Herald. Novelistic tones still vibrating from Buchanan's less compelling 1990 police procedural, Nobody Lives Forever-- particularly those emanating from plucked heartstrings--are what distinguish this new crime roundup from Corpse. Again, Buchanan proclaims her love affair with Miami (``The hot-blooded heartbeat of this passionate and mercurial city touches my soul'') and only whispers of her checkered romantic life--but where in Corpse the hundreds of case histories took a hard edge, focusing on drugs, the perils of reporting, etc., here they emphasize sentiment, focusing often on heroes, mostly fallen, and love, usually gone terribly awry. The opening chapter, ``Putting It in the Newspaper,'' for instance, is a litany of cases in which Buchanan effected good by reporting stories--of a missing person, a homeless woman, etc. The second chapter, a clutch of heroic dog and other animal tales, also makes an emotional pitch--delivered, however, in solid declarative prose that firms the mush (``Few four-footed heroes receive accolades. Most are unsung, many without a home''). A flurry of cases--of criminal Christmases, historic crimes, homicidal love, cop heroes, rescuers, odd occurrences (such as that of the barbiturate-soaked gunman who took 26 direct hits from cops' guns and kept shooting until a 27th round took him down)--follows, sometimes so fast and furious that impact is lost. More moving are the longer ``stories'' that close the book, particularly that of the Southerland family--not a crime chronicle at all, but a testament to one family's courage in the face of cancer. Distinctly middle-drawer files--but still a generous bonanza for crime buffs, presented by one of the sharpest writers in the field. -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Stuart collected guns, herded cattle, mined for gold, and killed men he thought outlaws. But he also taught himself Shoshone, French, and Spanish, denounced formal religion, married a Shoshone woman, and eventually became a United States diplomat.<br> In this fascinating biography, Clyde A. Milner II and Carol A. O'Connor, co-editors of the acclaimed <em>Oxford History of the American West,</em> trace Stuart's remarkable trajectory from his birth in Virginia, through his formative years in the agricultural settlements of Iowa and the mining camps of Gold Rush California, to his rough-and-tumble life in Montana and his rise to prominence as a public figure. Along the way, we see Granville and his brother James battling bandits and horsethieves and becoming leaders of the new Montana territory. The authors explore Granville's life as a cattleman, including his role as the leader of a vigilante force, known as "Stuart's Stranglers," responsible for several hangings in 1884, his abandonment of his half-Shoshone children after his second marriage, his government service in offices ranging from the head of the Butte Public Library to U.S. Minister to Paraguay and Uruguay, and his final years, during which he composed a memoir, <em>Forty Years on the Frontier,</em> still widely read for its dramatic account of the era.<br> Written with narrative flair and a lively awareness of current issues in Western history, <em>As Big as the West</em> fully illuminates the conflicting realities of the frontier, where a man could speak of wiping out "half-breeds" while fathering 11 mixed-race children, and go from vigilante to diplomat in the space of a few years.<br></p><p><br><strong>Clyde A. Milner II</strong> and <strong>Carol A. O'Connor</strong> are professors of History at Arkansas State University, and co-editors of <em>The Oxford History of the American West</em>.

Sandweiss, author of <em>Passing Strange</em> and <em>Print the Legend</em><p></p><br>"Granville Stuart lived an extraordinary and complicated Western life, and then in his published writings he invented another one.

A miner and rancher, part mountain man, a frontier free-thinker and intellectual, vigilante hangman and a diplomat in South America, he knew everybody, the Butte millionaires and labor agitators. <em>As Big as the West</em> is a terrific saga which Milner and O'Connor researched for a decade and have told masterfully and eloquently. And it's also a portrait of the northern West as it evolved. This is one really good, useful book."--William Kittredge, author of <em>The Willow Field</em> and <em>The Next Rodeo</em><p></p><br>"This sensitive and brilliant biography reveals the extraordinary human complexity behind a life that edges on the mythic.

In this book&#x2015;part intellectual biography, part institutional history&#x2015;Sybil Gordon Kantor tells the story of the rise of modern art in America and of the man responsible for its triumph. Following the trajectory of Barr's career from the 1920s through the 1940s, Kantor penetrates the myths, both positive and negative, that surround Barr and his achievements.</p><p>Barr fervently believed in an aesthetic based on the intrinsic traits of a work of art and the materials and techniques involved in its creation. Kantor shows how this formalist approach was expressed in the organizational structure of the multidepartmental museum itself, whose collections, exhibitions, and publications all expressed Barr's vision. At the same time, she shows how Barr's ability to reconcile classical objectivity and mythic irrationality allowed him to perceive modernism as an open-ended phenomenon that expanded beyond purist abstract modernism to include surrealist, nationalist, realist, and expressionist art.</p><p>Drawing on interviews with Barr's contemporaries as well as on Barr's extensive correspondence, Kantor also paints vivid portraits of, among others, Jere Abbott, Katherine Dreier, Henry-Russell Hitchcock, Philip Johnson, Lincoln Kirstein, Agnes Mongan, J. B. Neumann, and Paul Sachs.</p></p><p>Sybil Gordon Kantor is an independent scholar living in Columbus, Ohio, and Lugano, Switzerland.<p>A handful of figures contributed to the establishment of modern art in the U.S. museum community: Juliana Force (Whitney Museum of American Art), Chick Austen (Wadsworth Atheneum), Duncan Phillips (Phillips Collection), and, preeminently, Alfred H. Barr Jr. In a book that serves as both a biography of Barr and a textbook on the theoretical foundation of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York, independent scholar Kantor focuses on the philosophical underpinnings of Barr's early life. He explores in great depth the philosophers, teachers, collectors, artists, and others who helped to form the mind of MoMA's founding director (Barr was a mere 27 at the time of his appointment). Barr's important and influential colleagues (Lincoln Kirstein, Agnes Mongan, Henry-Russell Hitchcock, Philip Johnson, and others from both inside and outside of MoMA) are placed in historical and personal context. This excellent treatment explores Barr's contribution both to modern art in America and to many of the museum practices that are now taken for granted. For a more traditional biographical treatment, see Alice Goldfarb Marquis's Alfred H. Barr, Jr.: Missionary for the Modern (LJ 4/15/89). Highly recommended for all collections with an interest in 20th-century art. Martin R. Kalfatovic, Smithsonian Inst.

A good, clean &amp; sound copy</p><p>Designed to make Philippians scholarship accessible to a broader readership, this commentary brings to life both the letter&#39;s historical setting and its vigorously theological purpose. Markus Bockmuehl considers a number of important studies of the social and religious context of first-century Philippi and critically engages with several approaches to Pauline interpretation, including questions of rhetoric and social convention. Theological highlights include the themes of Christian joy in all circumstances, the Philippians&#39; active partnership in the gospel, and above all the pervasive passion for a union with Christ in following his self-humbling example of service. Giving due attention both to the theological heritage of St. Paul&#39;s Jewish background and to the Greco-Roman social and religious setting of his readership, this commentary relates a well-grounded understanding of the letter&#39;s first-century impact to the wider concerns of Christian theology.Markus Bockmuehl presently serves as Lecturer in Divinity, Cambridge University. The author of numerous scholarly articles, he also wrote <i>Revelation and Mystery in Ancient Judaism and Pauline Christianity</i> and <i>This Jesus: Martyr, Lord, Messiah.</i> He is the translator and editor of G. Stemberger, <i>Introduction to the Talmud and Midrash</i> (2nd ed.), and is presently working on <i>Halakhah in the Synoptics and Acts</i> for the prestigious Compendia Rerum Iudaicarum ad Novum Testamentum series.<p></p></p><h2>Radical Enlightenment: Philosophy and the Making of Modernity 1650-1750</h2><p>In the wake of the Scientific Revolution, the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries saw the complete demolition of traditional structures of authority, scientific thought, and belief by the new philosophy and the philosophes, including Voltaire, Diderot, and Rousseau. The Radical Enlightenment played a part in this revolutionary process, which effectively overthrew all justification for monarchy, aristocracy, and ecclesiastical power, as well as man's dominance over woman, theological dominance of education, and slavery. Despite the present day interest in the revolutions of the eighteenth century, the origins and rise of the Radical Enlightenment have received limited scholarly attention. The greatest obstacle to the movement finding its proper place in modern historical writing is its international scope: the Racial Enlightenment was not French, British, German, Italian, Jewish or Dutch, but all of these at the same time.<br> In this wide-ranging volume, Jonathan Israel offers a novel interpretation of the Radical Enlightenment down to La Mettie and Diderot, two of its key exponents. Particular emphasis is placed on the pivotal role of Spinoza and the widespread underground international philosophical movement known before 1750 as Spinozism.</p><p><br><strong>Jonathan Israel</strong> is a professor in the School of Historical Studies, Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton<br><br>"His vast--and vastly impressive--book sets out to redefine the intellectual landscape of early modern Europe....Magnificent and magisterial, <em>Radical Enlightenment</em> will undoubtedly be one of the truly great historical works of the decade."--John Adamson, <em>Sunday Telegraph</em><p></p><br>"[A] magnificent...study of the impact of Spinoza and his philosophy on European cultural history....

Then a light clicked on for Ben&#x2014;and a consuming passion for learning that catapulted him from &#x201c;zero&#x201d; test grades to a Yale scholarship, a pioneering role in modern medicine, and an influence that has extended from inner-city schools to corporate boardrooms and Washington corridors of power.<br><br>What made the difference? Belief in his own potential, a commitment to education and making the most of his opportunities to learn, determination to make the world a better place, and faith in a God who knows no limits. Seeing the Big Picture.<br><br>In The Big Picture, Ben Carson reveals the spiritual and philosophical foundations that undergird not just his dramatic career, but his approach to all of life. As in his best-selling Gifted Hands Dr. Carson shares colorful behind-the-scenes anecdotes. As in Think Big, he describes his practical principles for success. But The Big Picture is more than an autobiography or a personal-effectiveness manual. Rather, it&#x2019;s a multifaceted look at the faith and vision that can see us all through hardship and failure, and stir us to bold exploits on behalf of something greater than ourselves.<br><br>Dr. Carson begins by describing how he cultivated a Big-Picture perspective in his own life. Then he discusses ways to which all of us can approach parenting, family, business and friendships with the Big Picture in mind. Finally he looks at some pressing social issues&#x2014;in particular, racial diversity, health care, and education&#x2014;and considers how we ought to view them and what we should do about them in light of the Big Picture.<br><br>Drawing on a vast array of experiences in roles ranging from trailblazing surgeon to public speaker, to husband and family man, Ben Carson shows how we can turn the course of our lives, out communities, our country, and our world by keeping the Big Picture always in mind.</p><p>A Renowned African-American Neurosurgeon Offers a Rich Perspective on the Things That Matter Most Gifted Hands, Ben Carson&#39;s successful autobiography, inspired readers through the story of an inner-city kid with poor grades and little motivation who became director of pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins University Hospital by the age of thirty-three. In his follow-up motivational book, Think Big, Ben shared his life philosophy and a down-to-earth strategy that anyone could follow to achieve success. Now, in The Big Picture, Dr. Carson offers readers an up-close look at a professional surgeon&#39;s life--and his unique perspective on priorities, race, society, success, and living out a life of faith in a complex world. A busy man who must make life and death decisions every day, Ben Carson has learned about the importance of priorities. A successful and compassionate man at the top of the medical profession, he demonstrates with his life accomplishments what can be done when people live life according to solid biblical values. Noted for his groundbreaking work in the technologically complex field of modern neurosurgery, Dr. Carson offers a surprisingly simple formula for health, happiness, and living wisely. A black man who has reached the top of a white-coated world, Ben Carson offers a unique philosophy on achieving success, improving relations between the races, what medical breakthroughs mean to all of us, and why we must work for positive change in our troubled society. It may be just one man&#39;s perspective. But this noted surgeon&#39;s anecdotal, page-turning book can help us all get a better grasp on what&#39;s really important in life and how we can all make a difference.Ben Carson is the director of pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins University and the author of two best-selling books, Gifted Hands and Think Big. A widely respected role model, he shares motivational insights with inner-city kids and corporate executives alike. He serves on the board at Yale University and on the board of the Kellogg Company.

Here, in four fat volumes, is the best selection of his non-fiction available, a trove of letters, essays, reviews, and journalism that is breathtaking in its scope and eclectic passions. Orwell had something to say about just about everyone and everything. His letters to such luminaries as Julian Symons, Anthony Powell, Arthur Koestler, and Cyril Connolly are poignant and personal. His essays, covering everything from &#34;English Cooking&#34; to &#34;Literature and Totalitarianism,&#34; are memorable, and his books reviews (Hitler&#39;s Mein Kampf, Mumford&#39;s Herman Melville, Miller&#39;s Black Spring, Goldsmith&#39;s The Vicar of Wakefield to name just a few) are among the most lucid and intelligent ever written. From 1943 to l945, he wrote a regular column for the Tribune, a left wing weekly, entitled &#34;As I Please.&#34; His observations about life in Britain during the war embraced everything from anti-American sentiment to the history of domestic appliances. A Nonpareil Book from David R. Godine.</p><p>Though his life was brief (1903-1950), Orwell was extremely prolific. In addition to penning two of the last century's greatest novels, he wrote reams of essays, journalistic pieces, and letters. Covering a 30-year period, this extensive four-volume set, originally published in 1968, collects the best of his nonfiction. Each volume is divided by year and intermixes his correspondence with news stories and discourses on numerous subjects. There is far more to Orwell than Animal Farm and 1984, and this beautiful collection reveals what a true intellect he was. Though probably more for academics, the books are priced reasonably enough for public library consideration. <br>Copyright 2001 Reed Business Information, Inc.While [Orwell] is best known for Animal Farm and 1984, most of his writing derived from his tireless work as a journalist, and thanks to David Godines welcome reissue of The Collected Essays, Journalism, and Letters of George Orwell, which has been out of print for a decade, readers can find it all in one place.

That 1 percent of France's 26 million citizens could have such an influence not only on decoration and the arts but also on conduct in society is documented in detail and in both black-and-white and color photographs. This scholarly and thoughtful (and occasionally pedantic) exploration investigates all parts of design, architecture, and thought: the manufacture of goods, such as wallpaper and carved woodwork; the artisans' practice in guilds and abbeys; the signs of status; the influence of the king through the Palace of Versailles; and the rise of yet another privileged class and reactions against rococo. More a social than an aesthetic exploration, this will find a place among expansive historical and design collections. <i>Barbara Jacobs</i></p><h2>New Foundations for Psychoanalysis</h2><p>In a study of the various foundations that have been proposed for psychoanalysis, French psychoanalyst Laplanche (U. of Paris) demonstrates that it cannot be epistemologically grounded in the background disciplines of biology, phylogenesis, mechanics or linguistics. Returning to the founding moment of psychoanalysis, he reconceptualizes the process and meaning of analysis through the elaboration of a general theory of seduction.

It covers: ï¿½ the primitive node structure; ï¿½ asymptotic notation for mathematically discussing performance characteristics; ï¿½ built-in arrays; ï¿½ list structures built from either nodes or arrays; ï¿½ iterators as an abstract model of enumerating the items in a sequence; ï¿½ stacks and queues for computing with last-in/first-out and first-in/first-out orderings; ï¿½ binary and general tree structures for searching or representing hierarchical relationships; ï¿½ min and max heaps for representing ordering based on priorities; ï¿½ graph structures for representing more general relationships between data elements; ï¿½ hash tables for the efficient retrieval of strings and other objects; and finally ï¿½ trade-offs between the structures, and strategies for picking the most appropriate ones. To understand the material in this book you should be comfortable enough in a programming language to be able to work with and write your own variables, arithmetic expressions, if-else conditions, loops, subroutines (also known as functions), pointers (also known as references or object handles), structures (also known as records or classes), simple input and output, and simple recursion. Because many different languages approach the construction of data structures differently, we use pseudo-code so that you can translate the code into your own language.</p><p></p><h2>Every Twelve Seconds: Industrialized Slaughter and the Politics of Sight (Yale Agrarian Studies Series)</h2><p><p>This is an account of industrialized killing from a participant&#x2019;s point of view. The author, political scientist Timothy Pachirat, was employed undercover for five months in a Great Plains slaughterhouse where 2,500 cattle were killed per day&#x2014;one every twelve seconds. Working in the cooler as a liver hanger, in the chutes as a cattle driver, and on the kill floor as a food-safety quality-control worker, Pachirat experienced firsthand the realities of the&nbsp;work of killing in modern society. He uses those experiences to explore not only the slaughter industry but also how, as a society, we facilitate violent labor and hide away that which is too repugnant to contemplate.</p><p>Through his vivid narrative and ethnographic approach, Pachirat brings to life massive, routine killing from the perspective of those who take part in it. He shows how surveillance and sequestration operate within the slaughterhouse and in its interactions with the community at large. He also considers how society is organized to distance and hide uncomfortable realities from view. With much to say about issues ranging from the sociology of violence and modern food production to animal rights and welfare, <i>Every Twelve Seconds</i>&nbsp;is an important and disturbing work.</p></p><p>A political scientist goes undercover in a modern industrial slaughterhouse to provide an account of killing work from the perspective of those who carry it out.

Understanding atomic structure and the physical mechanisms of radiation interactions is the foundation on which much of the current practice of radiological health protection is based. The work covers the detection and measurement of radiation and the statistical interpretation of the data. The procedures that are used to protect man and the environment from the potential harmful effects of radiation are thoroughly described. Basic principles are illustrated with an abundance of worked examples that exemplify practical applications. Chapters include problem sets (with partial answers) and extensive tables and graphs for continued use as a reference work. This completely revised and enlarged third edition includes thorough updates of the material, including the latest recommendations of the ICRP and NCRP.</p><p>JAMES E.

He is the author of three textbooks.From Reviews of the Second Edition:<br> <br> "What can I say? The second edition of 'Atoms, Radiation, and Radiation Protection' is much better than the first edition, and the first edition was great. [...] It is [...] one of the finest graduate-level texts on radiation protection. For someone teaching a graduate course on radiation protection, this is a 'must have' book. [...] Everything you might want or need on the road to understanding radiation interaction is clearly and concisely handled. [...] Don't think this is a book for graduate students and teachers alone, however; it is a fine reference for anyone working in radiation protection."<br> Physics Today<br> <br> "The strength of the book lies in its unique analyses of fundamental particle track structure, including Monte Carlo computations, the detail of the important stochastical nature of the interactions, manifest in microdosimetry, and their consequences in radiobiological effects of setting up the criteria for radiation protection."<br> Radiation and Environmental Biophysics<br> <br> "This book is an excellent text for graduate students in health physics, as it contains an appropriately detailed discussion about atomic and nuclear physics for such students.

And as salsa takes over both the dance floor and the condiment shelf, the influence of Latin culture is gaining momentum in American society as a whole. Yet the increasing visibility of Latinos in mainstream culture has not been accompanied by a similar level of economic parity or political enfranchisement. In this important, original, and entertaining book, Arlene Dï¿½vila provides a critical examination of the Hispanic marketing industry and of its role in the making and marketing of U.S. Latinos.<br><br> Dï¿½vila finds that Latinos' increased popularity in the marketplace is simultaneously accompanied by their growing exotification and invisibility. She scrutinizes the complex interests that are involved in the public representation of Latinos as a generic and culturally distinct people and questions the homogeneity of the different Latino subnationalities that supposedly comprise the same people and group of consumers. In a fascinating discussion of how populations have become reconfigured as market segments, she shows that the market and marketing discourse become important terrains where Latinos debate their social identities and public standing.</p><p>"Davila has entered the back rooms of a new and important sector of the advertising industry, shedding light on the people and businesses that are working to exploit the marketing hot buttons of Hispanic USA. <i>Latinos, Inc.</i> could become a scholarly milestone, a vivid portrayal of the strange marriage between cultural anthropology and merchandising strategies that forms an elemental ingredient of U.S. consumer society."&#x2014;Stuart Ewen, author of <i>PR!

His instruction is wise and accessible, a mix of insights and strategies, practical excercises, and exampleas classic stories from writers such as Erneit Hemingway, Anton Chekhov, and Eudora Welty.&#34;</p><p>The short story is a kind of fast fiction. It's like a novel, only, well, shorter, right? Wrong. "The short story is closer in spirit to the poem than it is to the novel," says Rick DeMarinis (<i>Borrowed Hearts: New and Selected Stories</i>). As in a poem, every word counts. Every metaphor need be carefully considered. Nothing can be wasted. "Unlike the novel," says DeMarinis, "which has ample time to build a history of the central character or characters, the short story lifts the window blinds on someone's life, then, after we've seen enough to understand something about that life, the blinds are closed."<p> With that in mind, DeMarinis reflects on the various fictional components--viewpoint, character, plot, imagery--as they relate to the short form. He also talks about how unsettling it can be to embark on a new story ("You don't begin with meaning, you end with it"), and how difficult it can be to find the right ending ("I've waited as long as ten years"). Throughout the book is a recurring command for wakefulness: pay very close attention and let nothing be lost on you, DeMarinis says. "Look at familiar people and things with such close attention that it seems you are seeing them for the first time." Write short stories only if you can't not write them, and steel yourself: "you've got to write tens of thousands of words before you begin to see improvement." DeMarinis proves a wonderful companion for the serious student of short fiction, though he'd surely balk at our use of "serious": "Writing isn't hard work," he says, "it's hard play." <i>--Jane Steinberg</i></p>Rick DeMarinis has taught writing at the University of Texas at El Paso.</p><h2>Fix-It and Forget-It Slow Cooker Diabetic Cookbook: 550 Slow Cooker Favorites&#x2015;to Include Everyone!</h2><p><b>The classic slow cooker cookbook for diabetics--with nearly 600,000 copies sold--now available in a larger format!</b><br><br>Millions of home cooks have fallen in love with the Fix-It and Forget-It cookbooks since the first title was released more than a dozen years ago.

Steven Epstein's astute and readable investigation focuses on the critical question of "how certainty is constructed or deconstructed," leading us through the views of medical researchers, activists, policy makers, and others to discover how knowledge about AIDS emerges out of what he calls "credibility struggles."<br><br>Epstein shows the extent to which AIDS research has been a social and political phenomenon and how the AIDS movement has transformed biomedical research practices through its capacity to garner credibility by novel strategies. Epstein finds that nonscientist AIDS activists have gained enough of a voice in the scientific world to shape NIH&#x2013;sponsored research to a remarkable extent. Because of the blurring of roles and responsibilities, the production of biomedical knowledge about AIDS does not, he says, follow the pathways common to science; indeed, AIDS research can only be understood as a field that is unusually broad, public, and contested. He concludes by analyzing recent moves to democratize biomedicine, arguing that although AIDS activists have set the stage for new challenges to scientific authority, all social movements that seek to democratize expertise face unusual difficulties.<br><br>Avoiding polemics and accusations, Epstein provides a benchmark account of the AIDS epidemic to date, one that will be as useful to activists, policy makers, and general readers as to sociologists, physicians, and scientists.</p><p>"The best empirical piece of work on the AIDS epidemic that I have read&#x2014;detailed, well-informed, and expressed in lucid and accessible prose."&#x2014;Charles E.

In <i>The Curse of Cash</i>, acclaimed economist Kenneth Rogoff explores the past, present, and future of currency, from ancient China to today&#x2019;s cryptocurrencies, showing why, contrary to conventional economic wisdom, paper money surprisingly lies at the heart of some of the world&#x2019;s most difficult problems.</p><p>Cash is becoming increasingly marginalized in the legal economy, but there is a record amount of it in circulation&#x2015;$1.4 trillion in U.S. dollars alone, or $4,200 for every American, mostly in $100 bills&#x2015;and most of it is used to finance tax evasion, corruption, terrorism, the drug trade, human trafficking, and the rest of a massive global underground economy. Paper money also cripples monetary policy by making it impossible for central banks to lower interest rates significantly below zero, and <i>The Curse of Cash</i> explains why countries must establish effective negative interest rate policies to manage the next financial crisis.</p><p>Even if governments take better control of paper currency, perhaps by phasing out large-denomination notes, cryptocurrencies raise old and new issues.

Kamalashila's short work is not widely known today, but according to the Dalai Lama, it is a most important text, and worthy of study by those new to Buddhism, because "on the basis of this knowledge you will be able to understand other treatises without great difficulty. This text can be like a key that opens the door to all other major Buddhist scriptures."<p> Throughout the book, the Dalai Lama emphasizes the importance of logical analysis of scriptures, even if they are in the Buddha's own words; some teachings, he stresses, "should not be taken literally, but need interpretation." And this is what he does in this clear and readable commentary, originally given in 1989 and now translated and published for the first time. Its 10 short chapters are on such familiar Buddhist themes as Training the Mind, Compassion, Identifying the Nature of Suffering, and The Practice of Calm Abiding.</p><p> "Through meditation," says the Dalai Lama, "we can train our minds in such a way that negative qualities are abandoned and positive qualities are generated and enhanced."

Author Michelle Fondin explores and explains each one in the seven chapters of this book, demystifying their role in facilitating healing, balance, personal power, and everyday well-being. She offers meditations and visualizations, yoga postures, breathing exercises, and Ayurvedic dietary practices to learn about and work with the chakras. You may choose to follow the healing practices for seven days, devoting one day to each chakra; for seven weeks, focusing on each chakra for a week at a time; or at your own pace, spending as long as you need on each chakra. Whether you are experiencing an illness brought on by imbalance, feeling sluggish because of seasonal changes, or simply wishing to deepen your study of the subtle body, you will find healing and rejuvenation while discovering the power of these vibrant energy vortices, your chakras.</p><p><strong>Michelle S.

She lives in Herndon, Virginia.<ul> </ul> <p>Balancing Your Chakras<br> <b><br> </b>In each chapter, I will give you tools to balance each of the seven main chakras. Along with dietary recommendations, and areas to explore for emotional and spiritual healing, I have included yoga poses for each chakra, pranayama breathing techniques, a guided meditation, and thoughts to ponder for the day. You can also take your daily practice a step further and wear the color of the chakra you&#x2019;re healing and carry with you throughout your day, the crystal or gem associated with the daily chakra. <br> And finally, it can be helpful to look at the ailments for each of the chakras. When I was ill with thyroid cancer, my healing ultimately took place when I took a good look at the fifth chakra. I believe all diseases are messages from the body indicating that something is off. In looking at diseases you might be experiencing, you can take a deeper look by knowing which chakra is out of balance. Taking medicine, removing a tumor, or even an organ or body part might be necessary to stop the spread of the disease, but it won&#x2019;t help you get to the root of it. Considering the &#x201c;why&#x201d; is important in complete and total healing. Sometimes you don&#x2019;t get an answer. But often you do. Through chakra balancing you learn to listen to your intuition, that still small voice inside of you, and you will have an inner knowing of how to heal. <br> One: The Root Chakra<br> Muladhara: Root<b><br> Element: Earth (Prithivi)<br> Color: Red<br> Mantra sound: LAM</b><br> Our journey begins at the base of the spine with the first chakra, <i>muladhara. </i>The word <i>muladhara</i> means &#x201c;foundation or base&#x201d; and comes from the two Sanskrit words <i>mul </i>meaning &#x201c;base&#x201d; and <i>adhara, </i>which means &#x201c;support&#x201d; or &#x201c;foundation&#x201d;. This is the first of the three elemental or material chakras in the body. Whilst it is associated with us being in our most basic state, it is no less important than the other chakras on our journey. In fact, it is by far the primary and fundamental chakra we must balance in order to enjoy our time here on earth. <br> The element of muladhara is earth or <i>prithivi</i> in Sanskrit. We are bound to earth through gravity. This is the thickest and most dense chakra of the seven. Everything we do to remain on earth is found here. Think of the word &#x201c;survival&#x201d;. We must find shelter, eat, sleep, and procreate. We must protect our environment, including nature and Mother Earth. We must find jobs, do work, and make money to fulfill our needs. We must obey the laws of nature, our environment, and society. <br> In the body, the first chakra is located in the middle of the perineum and includes the coccyx, the pelvic plexus, the base of the spine, and the first three vertebrae. The sense associated with the first chakra is the sense of smell and the sense organ is the nose. <br> The color we attribute to the base chakra is a deep color red. And the mantra or <i>bija </i>(seed) sound we can vocalize for the first chakra is LAM. <br> <br> First Chakra Ailments<b><br> </b>While the earth element rules the first chakra, the ailments that occur with imbalance resemble the same diseases or imbalances that occur with the Ayurvedic mind body type, Vata, which is not earth, but space and air. As you may deduct, the elements of space and air are polar opposites of the element earth. Therefore, healing can begin when you bring balance back to the earth element through proper grounding.<br> First chakra blockages may include constipation, hemorrhoids, sciatica pain, degenerative arthritis, knee troubles, anorexia nervosa or other eating disorders, anxiety disorders, fears, nightmares, and psychosis. Obesity would be the only ailment, in this list, caused by an excessive amount of the earth element. <br> First Chakra Energy: Solid Like a Rock<br> <b><br> </b>The energy of the first chakra is vital to our existence. It&#x2019;s a downward energy that grounds us and gives us stability. In your body, first chakra energy gives you your bone structure, feet, legs, and the large intestine to digest your food. Everything we eat comes from the earth and its energy. The homes we build and the structures we enjoy, such as libraries, movie theaters, and skyscrapers, all come from first chakra energy. Gravity keeps us in communion with our planet. The art of manifesting emanates from acceptance of our material existence. <br> <i>Tamas </i>is the type of energy that rules muladhara. Tamasic energy is slow, dull, inert. The Ayurvedic dosha that dominates the first chakra is Kapha, which is comprised of the elements of water and earth. <br> An overabundance of tamasic energy can make a person sluggish, lazy, overweight, and complacent. However, tamas is necessary when a pregnant woman grows a baby. She needs to be grounded, slow down, take more naps, reduce her activities, and eat more food. The same goes for the seasons. Winter is a tamasic season where nothing appears to be going on and nature seems dormant. Animals hibernate. Grass and trees stop growing. But this period of rest is necessary for the outburst of activity in the spring. <br> Kapha energy is similar to tamasic energy. A healthy Kapha person is grounded, slow, methodical, humble, and down-to-earth. Babies go through a Kapha phase to be able to experience life on earth fully and to grow properly. The two sense organs of Kapha are the nose and the mouth (tongue: taste). All babies first experience the world by putting things in their mouth. Babies sleep more than older children and adults. They are drawn to and fascinated by nature and the earth&#x2019;s elements. They are thus, perfect expressions of fully embracing earth energy. <br> Adult Kapha types, who are living in balance, are peaceful people to be around. They are loving, affectionate and kind. The solid foundation they have gives comfort to others by being the stable pillar to lean upon. <br> Living Life in the First Chakra: Security<br> <b><br> </b>In each of the chakras, there is a difference between embracing and accepting the energy and gifts from each chakra, and living solely from that chakra. As you awaken to the limitations in each chakra, you are driven to discover ways to operate from different levels of consciousness. It&#x2019;s human nature to want to explore and grow. However, not everyone operates from this level of thinking. Many people accept limitations as hard boundaries and don&#x2019;t seek to move beyond them. In the event that you&#x2019;re ready to extend beyond the limitations of your chakras, it&#x2019;s important to understand what living at the level of each chakra looks like. <br> People who live in first chakra energy are in survival mode. Their basic emotion is fear. They are only concerned with security and how to obtain it. The part of the brain responsible for survival is the brain stem or medulla and the limbic system comprised of the amygdala and the hippocampus. Fight-flight is a primitive response hardwired in these parts of the brain. The response of fight-flight is a reaction to fear and a need for survival. In animals the onset of these events help the animal determine if he will fight a predator or run away. Fight-flight is a chain reaction that begins in the amygdala. It includes a release of stress hormones, such as cortisol, adrenaline and noradrenaline. Your heart races, blood pressure goes up, your blood platelets get sticky, your immune system becomes suppressed, blood is shunted away from your digestive organs and moved toward the limbs, you sweat and you feel compelled to either run or fight. <br> This primitive response to real and present danger is useful sometimes. Let&#x2019;s suppose your small child runs into the street after a ball, you must have quick energy to run after him to save him from a moving car. Or if you&#x2019;re driving and another vehicle suddenly pulls out in front of you, you need fight-flight to slam on the brakes. However, it becomes not so useful when your life isn&#x2019;t in danger and you&#x2019;re responding to fear and not reality. People who live solely from the first chakra respond to fear most of the time. Their motives are fear of lack, fear of loss, fear of not enough and the &#x201c;What if&#x201d; syndrome. <br> First chakra people would rather stay in a dissatisfying job than risk losing job security or a steady paycheck. They are not often leaders, but followers with blind obedience. They fear standing out from the crowd and would rather blend in. <br> The need to fight for security can be seen in the job choices a first chakra person might choose. He might choose to be a soldier or police officer to ensure security of his city or country. They constantly seek favor and acceptance from their superiors and work hard to serve them. First chakra people strive for rewards while greatly fearing punishment. While they obey and look up to authority, they are often harsh with people under them. <br> Trust is a big issue for first chakra people. We learn trust in the first two years of life through the care of our parents and caretakers. If the care was consistent, loving, and present, we developed trust in others and in our environment. Through trust we develop the value of hope. However, if we were in homes where a parent was absent, or our needs were delayed or not taken care of properly, we learned to distrust that others or our environment would provide for us. Those stuck in the first chakra seems to be constantly working out trust issues and that is why they are fearful. <br> <br> Recognition of First Chakra Limitations<br> <b><br> </b>The first way to move beyond a limitation is to recognize it. As I pointed out, each thing in life has its strengths and weaknesses. That is the nature of duality. The muladhara chakra keeps us rooted to the earth. It allows us to fully enjoy our earthly existence and manifest our desires into material objects. Muladhara is solid, thick, dense, and real.<br> The flip side of muladhara is excessive fear that leads to worry, anxiety, and lack of trust. You can feel the weight of the gravitational pull downward and feel burdened and heavy. In an effort to ground yourself, you can overeat leading to being overweight or obese, which doesn&#x2019;t lead to healthy grounding but to disconnect from your body. <br> A person&#x2019;s whose foundation is shaky may feel that they never have enough or that what they do have will be taken away. They will hoard material goods and pile them up in their homes. They will be stingy or miserly with their money. <br> Think of the principle of survival of the fittest. When working the first chakra at its limitations, that is what we feel. <br> <br> Accepting First Chakra Gifts<br> <b><br> </b>We live on this beautiful, bountiful planet we call earth. Our planet is filled with lavish abundance. Our ability to experience this planet through our senses is what can make us appreciate the objects that this life has to offer. First chakra gifts tell us we our not in lack. All we have to do is look around and see the plentiful resources at our disposal. Nature brings us these free gifts we don&#x2019;t have to pay for. There is enough for everyone. <br> While gravity can seem weighty. It&#x2019;s necessary for us to live out our purpose in life. We need to dig our hands into the dirt (so to speak) and live in the here and now. <br> <br> Healing the Muladhara Chakra<br> <br> Daily affirmation: <i>I am secure and grounded. My basic needs are met. I am fearless. <br> </i><b><br> </b>Healing in the first chakra comes with acceptance that you have a physical body and by learning to appreciate and love it. Many people look at their bodies as a hindrance to getting where they want to go. They say things like, &#x201c;Oh, eating is such an inconvenience.&#x201d; Or &#x201c;If I didn&#x2019;t have to go to the bathroom or sleep so much I could get more done.&#x201d; Societal beliefs and norms have us believe that the body is designed to break down, experience disease and get worse with age. This is simply not true, those are just beliefs. <br> Women often have body image issues. They feel shameful or hate their bodies. They want their breasts to be smaller or bigger. They feel their thighs are too fat or their bottom is too thin. Men sometimes ignore the need to get a checkup or to hit the gym. <br> I recently had an Ayurvedic consultation with a client who has an inflammatory autoimmune disease. She was worried about taking Prednisone daily and wanted to get off it, but every time she tired she would experience the pain of her disease. In our consultation, I discovered her primary Ayurvedic mind body type was Vata and that she wasn&#x2019;t eating but once a day and was barely sleeping. I explained to her that if she wanted her body to heal, she had to get back into her body. She&#x2019;s a highly creative individual and loves her creative work. She embraces her space and air qualities so much that she lives daily in the ether and reinforces that by not eating or sleeping. Getting back into her body means she needs to take care of her body and do the grounding practices to feel she is living in her body. Then, and only then, will she be able to heal from her autoimmune disease. <br> Your beautiful body is comprised of the elements of the earth: space, air, fire, water and earth. You are a part of this amazing and miraculous existence. First, accepting your body as a vehicle through which you experience life is essential. Next, honoring your body by feeding it the proper foods, exercising it, and giving it adequate sleep shows you respect it. <br> <br> Eating as a Sacred Act<br> <br> In Western society, we don&#x2019;t take the time to appreciate the food we eat daily. We often eat food on the go, eat in our vehicles, while walking, or skip meals throughout the day. The act of preparing food, serving it and eating it should be a sacred act. Our body is the only channel through which we enjoy our time on earth. Loving your body means appreciating its needs and benefiting from its strengths. <br> To reconnect with your body through the act of eating, commit to taking at least one meal in silence today. Shop for your food in gratitude and excitement at the prospect of sharing the gift of a meal with your body. Prepare the food with love. Take the time to smell your food and taste each and every bite. Be grateful to Mother Earth for providing you with the nourishment and sustenance you need to live. <br> Yoga Asanas and Pranayama Exercises to Heal the First Chakra<br> <br> Practicing yoga is a great way to heal your chakras. To heal the first chakra, you will focus on grounding poses or any pose that engages the base of the spine and the area of the perineum. <br> Each of the chakras will have descriptions of the pranayama breathing techniques and yoga poses. You can check out demonstrations of all of these on my You Tube channel.<br> Dirgha: The Three-Part Yoga Breath<br> <br> For the first chakra balancing you will focus on the tip of the nose with your eyes closed while practicing the complete breath. As you breathe, you will visualize your belly as a balloon. Inflate the balloon on the inhalation and deflate the balloon on the exhalation. The complete breath is done through the nose only with the lips closed. Begin the three-part breath by inhaling first from the lower belly below the belly button, then expanding to the mid-belly and then allowing the air to rise up into the chest. As you exhale, you will deflate the chest, then mid-belly and lower abdomen.

Agresto examines the role of the judiciary in a democratic society and discusses the proper place of congressional power in constitutional issues. Agresto argues that while the separation of congressional and judicial functions is a fundamental tenet of American government, the present system is not effective in maintaining an appropriate balance of power. He shows that continued judicial expansion, especially into the realm of public policy, might have severe consequences for America's national life and direction, and offers practical recommendations for safeguarding against an increasingly powerful Supreme Court. John Agresto's controversial argument, set in the context of a historical and theoretical inquiry, will be of great interest to scholars and students in political science and law, especially American constitutional law and political theory.</p></p><p><p>John Agresto is the author of <i>Mugged by Reality: The Liberation of Iraq and the Failure of Good Intentions</i> and <i>Rediscovering America: Liberty, Equality, and the Crisis of Demoracy</i>.</p><p>"To put it quite simply, this is an extradordinarily good book.

Heinlein, author of numerous New York Times best sellers. He starred in Heinlein&#39;s most popular novels, including Methuselah&#39;s Children, Time Enough For Love, The Number Of The Beast, To Sail Beyond The Sunset and others. The oldest living member of the human race due to his unique genes, Long has been a pioneer on eight planets, survived wars and lynch mobs, and explored most of the galaxy. His adventures have given him a breadth of experience distilled through the irony of an immortal viewpoint. But there is nothing pompous about Long&#39;s reflections on the human condition. As the noted editor and critic David G. Hartwell has observed, &#34;Lazarus&#34; comments are acute, lively and intelligent.&#34; And here they are, compiled in one beautifully designed trade paperback, filled with illuminations and illustrations by renowned Science Fiction artist Stephen Hickman, for the delight of the millions of Heinlein fans around the world.</p><p>Long appeared in Heinlein's series of 'future history' novels and was the oldest living member of the human race: his adventures are detailed in these 'notebooks' which provide excellent visual illustration throughout.

Square, who takes a tour of his bizarre homeland. This tour provides a hilarious satire on Victorian society with questions about the nature of the universe.</p></p><p><i>Flatland</i> is one of the very few novels about math and philosophy that can appeal to almost any layperson. Published in 1880, this short fantasy takes us to a completely flat world of two physical dimensions where all the inhabitants are geometric shapes, and who think the planar world of length and width that they know is all there is. But one inhabitant discovers the existence of a third physical dimension, enabling him to finally grasp the concept of a fourth dimension. Watching our Flatland narrator, we begin to get an idea of the limitations of our own assumptions about reality, and we start to learn how to think about the confusing problem of higher dimensions. The book is also quite a funny satire on society and class distinctions of Victorian England.<p> <em>Flatland</em> (1884) is an influential mathematical fantasy that simultaneously provides an introduction to non-Euclidean geometry and a satire on the Victorian class structure, issues of science and faith, and the role of women. A classic of early science fiction, the novel takes place in a world of two dimensions where all the characters are geometric shapes. The narrator, A Square, is a naï¿½ve, respectable citizen who is faced with proof of the existence of three dimensions when he is visited by a sphere and is forced to see the limitations of his world. </p> <p> The introduction to this Broadview Edition provides context for the book&#x2019;s references to Victorian culture and religion, mathematical history, and the history of philosophy.

In this wonderfully readable account, Fraser Smith explores the formative influences, backroom deals, personal relationships, quirky Baltimorisms, vicious fights, civic pride, splashes in the National Aquarium seal pool, victories, defeats, draws&#x2015;everything that makes Schaefer's career colorful and that helps us to understand the man himself.</p><p>A seasoned reporter who covered Schaefer's terms as mayor and governor for the <i>Baltimore Sun</i>, Smith takes a serious-minded but also throughly human-interest approach to his subject&#x2015;a study in character and the capacity of certain people to make a difference in the story of their time and locale. In Schaefer's case, the story concerns the struggle of Baltimore to survive and, if possible, renew itself. Smith draws on a sizable body of documentary source material; his scores of interviews provide him with juicy quotation and vibrant commentary. The book includes a gallery of photos, most never before published, which recall memorable moments in Schaefer's eventful career.</p><p><i>William Donald Schaefer: A Political Biography</i> will fascinate Maryland voters, appeal to students of twentieth-century America, and engage anyone who loves a good story well told.</p><p>"His life in politics had been vouchsafed by do gooders, club house operators, slick businessmen, and others. He managed to find the best in each of these without being a servant to any. He was a classic 1950s-style Can-Do man, a veteran of the Second World War, a holdover from the time in American life when learning from experience and respected elders was a way of life. He was a career politician who ran for office to serve&#x2015;to work for people, to care about their welfare. He wanted to think of himself&#x2015;and to have others think of him&#x2015;as a distinguished city father, a public servant.

Alexandre Dumas began writing at an early age and saw his first success in a play he wrote entitled <b>Henri III et sa Cour</b> (1829). A prolific author, Dumas was also an adventurer and took part in the Revolution of 1830. Dumas is most famous for his brilliant historical novels, which he wrote with collaborators, mainly Auguste Maquet, and which were serialized in the popular press of the day. His most popular works are <b>The Three Musketeers</b>(1844), <b>The Count of Monte Cristo</b> (1844-45), and <b>The Man in Iron Mask</b> (1848-50). Dumas made and lost several fortunes, and died penniless on on December 5, 1870.Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>The Lost Museum: The Nazi Conspiracy To Steal The World&#39;s Greatest Works Of Art</h2><p>Between 1939 and 1944, as the Nazis overran Europe, they were also quietly conducting another type of pillage. <i>The Lost Museum</i> tells the story of the Jewish art collectors and gallery owners in France who were stripped of rare works by artists such as Vermeer, Rembrandt, Degas, Cï¿½zanne, and Picasso. Before they were through, the Nazis had taken more than 20,000 paintings, sculptures, and drawings from France. <i>The Lost Museum</i> explores the Nazis' systematic confiscation of these artworks, focusing on the private collections of five families: Rothschild, Rosenberg, Bernheim-Jeune, David-Weill, and Schloss. The book is filled with private family photos of this art, some of which has never before been seen by the public, and it traces the fate of these works as they passed through the hands of top German officials, unscrupulous art dealers, and unwitting auction houses such as Christie's and Sotheby's.</p><p>Pillage is one of the traditional perks of warfare. But it took Adolf Hitler to systematize the decimation and despoiling of cultures, and it took Hector Feliciano seven years to track five famous art collections stolen by the Nazis. He uncovered not only Nazi schemes but also a well-oiled machine of collaborators, informants, moving companies, and neighbors, all with their fingers in the pie. <i>The Lost Museum</i> reads like a good detective story. Inspired by a fascination with the theft of five prominent Parisian Jewish families' art collections, it focuses on the beneficiaries of the thefts and justice for its victims. Filled with family photos of the art, some never before seen by the public, <i>The Lost Museum</i> tracks the pieces as they passed through the hands of German officials, unscrupulous art dealers, and unsuspecting auction houses. That the network was so deviously intricate illustrates the enormous challenge of restitution. <p> The relationship between Nazi higher-ups, keen to advance their own collections, and non-Jewish dealers bodes well for the Parisian art scene. A Picasso for a Titian; two classics for eleven late-19th-/early-20th-century moderns? Such wheeling and dealing reduces art to tug-of-war commodities, and Feliciano's <i>The Lost Museum</i> at times seems to question nothing less than what art serves, and who profits from it. If you like a good detective story and can tolerate the frustration of justice impaired by greed, then this thoroughly documented dark tale is for you.</p><b>Hector Feliciano</b> is editor-in-chief of World Media Network.

Rather than focusing exclusively on the women of noble or wealthy merchant families, Chojnacka explores the lives of women&#x2015;unmarried, married, or widowed&#x2015;who worked for a living and helped keep the city running through their labor, services, and products. </p><p>Among Chojnacka's surprising findings is the degree to which these working women exercised control over their own lives. Many headed households and even owned their own homes; when necessary, they also took in and supported other women of their families. Some were self-employed, while others had jobs outside the home. They often moved freely about the city to conduct business, and they took legal action in the courts on their own behalf. On a daily basis, Venetian women worked, traveled, and contested obstacles in ways that made the city their own.</p></p><p><p><b>Monica Chojnacka </b> is an assistant professor of history at the University of Georgia.</p><p>"A skillfully crafted, sparkling testament to these women [of Early Modern Venice]&#x2015;and to their courage, determination, and dignity."</p> (Robert A.

Early seafarers were wary of them, naturalists were confused by them, yet many coastal people benefited greatly from these mysterious rocky structures that grew up to the surface of the sea. They have been rich in their supply of food, and they provided a breakwater from storms and high waves to countless coastal communities that developed from their protection. Their scale is enormous and their value high. Found in countless locations around the world, from the Indo-Pacific coral reef province to the Caribbean and Australia, they support both marine and human life. <br><br>In this <em>Very Short Introduction</em>, Charles Sheppard provides an account of what coral reefs are, how they are formed, how they have evolved, and the biological lessons we can learn from them. Today, the vibrancy and diversity of these fascinating ecosystems are under threat from over exploitation and could face future extinction, unless our conservation efforts are stepped up in order to save them.<br><br><strong>ABOUT THE SERIES:</strong> The <em>Very Short Introductions</em> series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost every subject area.

She graduated from the Cooking and Hospitality Institute of Chicago (CHIC), a Le Cordon Bleu certified program.</p>Dietician Rondinelli and chef Bucko make cooking five healthy dinners a week&#x2014;for an entire year&#x2014;look like a no-brainer in this simple cookbook. They divide their book by month, and within each month, they give four weeks&#x2019; worth of main courses (presumably for dinner, though they could certainly make nice lunches). A grocery list begins each week, followed by the recipes, which generally fall under the "continental" umbrella, with Mediterranean, Latin, Asian and other influences. Although no dish requires more than four steps, and prep times range from 5 to 20 minutes per recipe, there are plenty of intriguing dinner options, such as Three-Pepper Pasta Salad with Goat Cheese, or Chicken with Portabello Tofu Sauce. Rondinelli and Bucko also feature one dessert for each month, which are the book&#x2019;s weakest link, as they often take the easy way out: Cherry Tarts, for example, require canned "light" cherry pie topping. Sidebars give further information on ingredients and advice for alternate preparation methods, and every recipe includes the dish&#x2019;s nutritional information.<br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

I just mean that if you are human, you are an amazing piece of biological machinery. If you are not human, please let me know immediately. We would like to dissect and study you for the upcoming Junior Genius Guides: Alien Beings.<br> <br>The chemicals in your body are nothing special&#x2014;common stuff you could buy with a little allowance money. In fact, you could recreate most of your body just by turning on a faucet. More than half of you is actually water!<br> <br><br> <br>So, if you are an eighty-pound human looking to rebuild your body with a chemistry set, buying the elements shown in the chart would set you back about $160. More than half the money would go to buying potassium, a kind-of-rare mineral found in foods such as oranges and bananas. Your body needs potassium to keep your blood pressure healthy and your muscles working.<br> <br><br><br>EXTRA CREDIT<br> <br>Your body doesn&#x2019;t need gold to survive, but you do have some in your tissues, from tiny traces of it in the food you eat and water you drink. But you&#x2019;re not going to strike it rich by selling your boogers and earwax to a late-night gold infomercial! The total amount of gold in your body is about the size of a grain of sand.<br><br>But when you combine the elements in your body, your value skyrockets. Let&#x2019;s say you sold every part of you on the open market&#x2014;your organs, your bone marrow, your DNA, your antibodies. I would advise against this, however. Not only is it illegal, but you sort of need some of that stuff. But if you had a clearance sale and everything had to go, your body could bring in about $45 million!<br> <br>That&#x2019;s because your body is made of very ordinary elements combined in extraordinary ways.<br> LADDER PERFECT<p></p> <br>Like all other life on earth, human beings are carbon-based. This means that the big, complicated molecules that power us, like proteins and carbohydrates, are all based on the element carbon. Yup, the same stuff that charcoal and diamonds and graphite are made out of. Your body has enough carbon in it to provide the graphite for more than six thousand pencils!<br> <br><br> <br>One of the most important of these carbon-based molecules is deoxyribonucleic acid. Most people call it DNA to save time, and because it&#x2019;s much easier to spell. DNA is a long, skinny molecule shaped like a twisted ladder (or a &#x201c;double helix,&#x201d; as a biologist would say).<br> <br><br> <br>Why is DNA so complicated? Because it contains all the information necessary to make you . . . you. It&#x2019;s how a skin cell knows how to divide itself into new skin cells, and how a liver cell knows how to make new liver cells. There&#x2019;s a reason why dogs don&#x2019;t give birth to kittens and cats don&#x2019;t give birth to puppies, and that reason is DNA. The DNA ladder is divided into long sections called genes, which contain instructions on how to pass along heredity information. Do you have brown eyes? Eye color is a gene. Curly hair? The ability to roll your tongue? Morton&#x2019;s Toe? (That&#x2019;s when your second toe is longer than your big toe.) Those traits are all in your genes.<br> <br><br><br>EXTRA CREDIT<br> <br>There&#x2019;s even a human gene named for Sonic the Hedgehog! The SHH gene makes sure that your body grows your fingers and brain tissues in the right places.<br><br><br> <br>The rungs of the ladder in each molecule of DNA are chemicals called bases. There are four different bases: adenine, guanine, thymine, and cytosine. You know what? Let&#x2019;s keep it simple and call them A, G, T, and C. The pattern of As, Gs, Ts, and Cs on your DNA molecules is like a secret code that contains all the instructions your cells needed to grow into a person. Your whole genome&#x2014;the entire code&#x2014;is three billion base pairs long. That&#x2019;s enough space to encode an entire shelf of encyclopedias!<br><br>MR. GREEN GENES<br> <br>DNA isn&#x2019;t just a human thing, Junior Geniuses. Pretty much all life on earth is based on DNA. Don&#x2019;t get me wrong, I love humans. We are the only organisms on earth with speech, opposable thumbs, video games, and pizza. But not everything in our genome is so special. Did you know that . . .<br> <br>99% of your DNA is the same as a chimpanzee&#x2019;s?<br> <br>97% of your DNA is the same as an orangutan&#x2019;s?<br> <br>80% of your DNA is the same as a mouse&#x2019;s?<br> <br>50% of your DNA is the same as a banana&#x2019;s?<br> <br>You may not be yellow, potassium-rich, and delicious on cereal, but you and bananas are distant branches on the same family tree&#x2013;the tree of life on earth.<br> <br> PIECES OF ME<p></p> <br>Your DNA is found in every single cell of your body. In fact, there are almost six feet of DNA crammed into each tiny cell. Since the human body has about forty trillion cells in it, that means that you contain more than forty-five billion miles of DNA . . . enough to stretch between the sun and Pluto twelve times!<br> <br><br> <br>But what is a cell exactly? In 1665 the British scientist Robert Hooke was looking through a microscope at a thin slice of cork. He was surprised to see this:<br> <br><br> <br>The wood was divided into boxy structures, which reminded him of small rooms. He called them cells, like the small rooms where monks or prisoners lived, and the name stuck. Cells are the building blocks of life. All the tissues that make up life on earth, from rose petals to jellyfish tentacles to human brains, are made out of cells.<br> <br><br> <br>Human cells aren&#x2019;t boxy like the ones Hooke saw. Only plant cells, it turns out, have rigid walls. Under a very powerful microscope, one of your cells might look more like this.<br> <br><br> <br>You have many different types of cells. A bone cell is very different from a brain cell, which is very different from a blood cell. This is a good thing, or you would be a very strange-looking person indeed.<br><br>YOUNG AT HEART<br> <br>Keeping all the cells of your body up-to-date is a never-ending job. Every minute, cell division replaces ninety-six million dead cells all over your body. Blink your eyes once. Go ahead. Guess what? During that blink you got half a million new cells! Congratulations!<br> <br>Are you around ten years old? Maybe a little less, maybe a little more? Here&#x2019;s a secret: so am I, and so are your grandparents, and so is every other adult you know. Because human cells die and get replaced every decade or so, that means that the average age of my cells is about ten years. Most of me isn&#x2019;t old enough to drive!<br> <br> SMALL WONDER<p></p> <br>Your body didn&#x2019;t always have forty trillion cells. At first you had only one!<br> <br>The path toward human life begins when the largest cell in the human body, a female egg cell, is fertilized by the smallest cell in the human body, a male sperm cell. These two are a real odd couple. A sperm cell weighs 175,000 times less than the egg, which is the only human cell so large it can be seen with the naked eye. For the first half hour of existence, you were just a single fertilized cell, called a zygote.<br> <br><br> <br>How does that one cell eventually know how to turn into bones and nerves and muscles and all the other kinds of cells the body will need? Because human embryos are made of an amazing kind of cell called a stem cell. Stem cells aren&#x2019;t specialized. They haven&#x2019;t decided what they want to be when they grow up. They have the power to turn into a stomach cell or a lung cell or a blood cell or whatever you need. Today scientists are studying ways to use stem cells to save lives by curing diseases or even regrowing whole organs from scratch!<br> <br><br><br>EXTRA CREDIT<br> <br>For the first five to six weeks of development, you all had something in common. You were female! Well, sort of. It might be more accurate to say that you were all genderless. The Y chromosome, present only in males, doesn&#x2019;t kick in until more than a month after conception. For that first month, growing human embryos of both sexes look exactly the same.<br> <br> WOMB FOR ONE MORE<p></p> <br>About once in every eighty pregnancies, something a little different happens. Either two egg cells get fertilized at once or a fertilized cell splits into two separate embryos.<br> <br>What happens then? You get twins.<br> <br><br> <br>Twins from the same zygote are called identical twins. Identical twins have the same genes, which means their DNA is not exactly the same but very, very similar. Even their fingerprints are very, very similar.<br><br>POP QUIZ<br> <br>Twins aren&#x2019;t the only kind of multiple birth, of course. One in every six thousand natural pregnancies results in triplets, and one in every seven hundred thousand produces quadruplets! Now that doctors have developed fertility treatments to help couples conceive children, multiple births are becoming more common.<br> <br>The only group of eight multiples ever to survive is the Suleman family of Southern California. What is a set of eight siblings born at once called?<br> <br><br><br>Even before they&#x2019;re born, twins have a very special relationship. In ultrasound videos they can be seen reaching for and touching each other in the womb, and they interact socially with each other when they&#x2019;re just a few hours old. As kids, 40 percent of twins even develop a made-up &#x201c;twin talk&#x201d; language that they use only with each other!<br> <br><br> <br>The unusual closeness between twins can be a lifelong thing. For example, let&#x2019;s meet Jim Lewis and Jim Springer. They were adopted as babies and raised by separate families in western Ohio. When they were finally reunited forty years later, in 1979, they were shocked by the similarities between them. It wasn&#x2019;t just their looks and mannerisms. Both had married women named Linda, and then been remarried to women named Betty. Both had a son named James Allan/Alan and had a dog named Toy. Both drove Chevys, liked woodworking, served as sheriff&#x2019;s deputies, and vacationed at the same Florida beach!<br><br>LET&#x2019;S PUT OUR HEADS TOGETHER<br> <br>Here&#x2019;s a pair of twins who are even closer: Krista and Tatiana Hogan. They&#x2019;re conjoined twins, meaning the stem cells in their bodies grew together before they were born. Most twins with this condition are joined at the chest or stomach, but the Hogan girls are joined at the brain! When Krista thinks something, Tatiana can hear it. When Tatiana looks at something, Krista can see it too.<br> <br> I WILL SURVIVE<p></p> <br>When you were born, you looked a little different from how you do now. To put it bluntly, you had a big head. An adult&#x2019;s head is about one- eighth of his or her height, but a baby&#x2019;s head is one-quarter of its height! And the baby&#x2019;s head even has a hole in it! When babies are born, the bones of their skull haven&#x2019;t quite grown together yet, so they actually have &#x201c;soft spots&#x201d; called fontanelles on their heads. Sometimes you can even see it pulsing with their little heartbeat.<br> <br><br><br>EXTRA CREDIT<br> <br>The human body has 206 bones, but babies are born with about 300! Where do the 94 extra bones go? Do babies lose them like teeth? Nope, the bones just fuse together to form fewer (but bigger) bones as we grow up.<br><br>Despite their small size and incomplete bones, babies are tough. Pound for pound a newborn baby is stronger than an ox. In fact, the human body is a pretty resilient piece of equipment. Here are some things your body could possibly survive, if it had to.<br> <br>NOTE: These are worst-case scenarios, Junior Geniuses. Do not try them at home!<br> <br><br> <br>Being bitten 173 times by poisonous snakes! Bill Haast, who ran a Florida snake venom lab, handled more than three million poisonous snakes during his career. He made himself immune to snakebites by injecting himself with deadly venom every day for sixty years, and lived to be one hundred years old.<br> <br><br> <br>Being frozen in ice for more than an hour! Anna Bï¿½genholm, a Swedish skier, fell into an icy Norwegian stream in 1999 and couldn&#x2019;t be pulled out for eighty minutes! The extreme hypothermia must have put her body into some kind of hibernation state, because she made an almost full recovery.<br> <br><br> <br>Cooking steak and eggs . . . from inside the oven! In 1775 a British scientist named Charles Blagden took his dog, a steak, and some eggs into a room heated to 220ï¿½F&#x2014;hot enough to boil water. After fifteen minutes the steak and eggs had cooked, but Dr. Blagden (and his dog!) were just fine.<br> <br><br> <br>An electric drill through the brain! In 2003 a California man named Ron Hunt fell off a ladder onto his drill, which went through his eye and into his brain, and exited out the back of his skull. Hunt never lost consciousness and was rushed to the hospital with the giant drill bit still coming out of his face. Surgeons removed it by unscrewing it like a giant screw!<br> <br><br> TO THE EXTREME<p></p> <br>Despite those amazing survival stories, Junior Geniuses, the human body does have its limits. Let&#x2019;s meet a few of the people who have tested those limits.<br> <br>Tallest. Robert Wadlow of Illinois had a glandular condition that made his body grow at an amazing speed. By the time he was six years old, he was taller than his father, and his shoe size was 37 AA&#x2014;a foot and a half long! He was eight-foot-eleven and still growing when he died of an infection in 1940, at age twenty-two.<br> <br>Shortest. The world&#x2019;s shortest adult on record is a Nepalese villager named Chandra Bahadur Dangi. Dangi has dwarfism and stands just 21.5 inches tall&#x2014;less than three times the height of this book!<br> <br>Fastest. At around the seventieth meter of a hundred-meter race, Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt is traveling at almost twenty-eight miles per hour, the fastest human foot speed ever recorded.<br> <br><br> <br>Oldest. Jeanne Calment of Arles, France, lived from 1875 to 1997&#x2014;more than 122 years! The amazingly healthy Madame Calment took up fencing at age eighty-five and went bicycle-riding until she was one hundred. She is certainly the only person ever to meet Vincent van Gogh (as she did as a girl in 1888) and then go on to record a rap album (which she did in 1996).<br> <br><br> <br>Youngest. I hate to brag, my friends, but there was a time when I was the youngest person in the world. Not anymore, of course. Now it&#x2019;s a new baby that was just born a second ago. Oh, no, wait. Now it&#x2019;s a different baby. Oops, I&#x2019;m wrong. Now it&#x2019;s another baby. . . .<br><br>FOR MEDICINAL PORPOISES ONLY<br> <br>The world&#x2019;s tallest man in the early 2000s was Bao Xishun, a seven-foot-nine herdsman from northern China.

Not that you could tell by looking at the old ham, who for some reason never seems to age--or stay out of trouble. Sparky's in the midst of a whirlwind theatrical tour designed to bring a bit of culture to the frozen desolation of the outer solar system when bad luck strikes in the form of a gumshoe hot on his tail. Sparky decides to skip the outer burgs for the more hospitable environs of Pluto, but things only get worse when he runs afoul of the notoriously unforgiving Charonese Mafia. As he's making his getaway, he learns something astonishing. The famous director Kaspara Polichinelli of Luna is planning a performance of King Lear, and he's short a lead to take on the title role. Sparky wires Polichinelli that he's interested, and Polichinelli tells him the part is his. Now all Sparky has to do is find a way to scrape together enough cash to get to Luna before the play starts while avoiding a seemingly unstoppable (and unkillable) Charonese hitman. <i>--Craig E.

By reviewing the contexts in which entrepreneurship has flourished, the authors are able to judge its record of successes and failures. Prospects for future manifestations of the entrepreneur are then clarified and assessed. As a part of this analysis, they discuss such issues as the historical conceptions of entrepreneurship, entrepreneurship in ecconomic theory, the role of the entrepreneur in innovation, and popular notions of the entrepreneur.</p></p><p><p>ROBERT F.

Drawing on a lifetime of distinguished teaching, he issues a clear call to action for improving what goes on in America's classrooms. The result is an extraordinarily fresh, sensible, and practical program for better schools.<br><br>"It is difficult to imagine a more pungent, perceptive or eloquent commentary on contemporary American education than this collection of 15 pieces by Jacques Barzun."&#x2014;Jonathan Yardley, <i>Washington Post Book World</i><br><br>"Mr. Barzun's style is elegant, distinctive, philosophically consistent and much better-humored than that of many contemporary invective-hurlers."&#x2014;David Alexander, <i>New York Times Book Review</i></p><p>This book gathers the various writings and comments of outspoken educator Barzun ( The American University , LJ 10/1/68), regarding the ailing American educational system. These freshly edited articles and essays offer a way out of a decaying system through teaching and learning in an old-fashioned way, rather than through the "radical innovations" of the so-called educational reformers. Some of the topics Barzun addresses include the inadequate ways in which reading is taught; the demeaning methods of teacher training; the counterfeit "social studies" programs which are the offshoot of combined geography and history curriculums; the benefits of reading the classics; and the effects of television on learning. In this collection one will find what schools and colleges should and could be if reforms are to "begin here." This is a practical, positive approach to developing better schools and colleges.<br><i>- Samuel T. Huang, Northern Illinois Univ.

In this book two philosophers each committed to unambiguous versions of belief and disbelief, debate the central issues of atheism and theism.</p><p>The issue of whether or not there is a God is one of the oldest and most widely disputed philosophical questions. It is a debate that spreads far across the range of philosophical questions about the status of science, the nature of mind, the character of good and evil, the epistemology of experience and testimony, and so on. In this book two philosophers, each committed to unambiguous versions of belief and disbelief, debate the central issues of atheism and theism. <p>Smart opens the debate by arguing that theism is philosophically untenable and seeks to explain metaphysical truth in the light of total science. Haldane continues the discussion by affirming that the existence of the world, and the possibility of our coming to have knowledge of it, depend upon the existence of a creating, sustaining, personal God. Concluding with their replies to each other, each philosopher has the chance to respond and to defend his position.</p><b>J. J. C.

Over a period of several years she and George Voss fall in love, but George&#39;s father Michel forbids them to marry.</p><p>Set in a village in the Vosges mountains in north-eastern France, The Golden Lion of Granpere (1867) was written when Trollope was at the height of his popularity. The novel concerns the events in the lives of an innkeeper&#39;s family; the relationship between George Voss, the landlord&#39;s son, and his beloved Marie, the rivalry between Voss and another suitor for Marie&#39;s hand in marriage, and the results of a betrothal based on mutual misunderstandings. A small-scale work, precise and detailed, it demonstrated a skill and level of social analysis peculiarly Trollope&#39;s own. This is a romance devoid of political dimension, yet acutely attentive to what a contemporary critic called &#39;the characteristic dress in which the small diplomacies of all kinds of social life clothe themselves&#39;.As young adult, Trollope endured seven years of poverty in the General Post Office in London before accepting a better-paying position as postal surveyor in Banagher, Ireland in 1841. The years in Ireland formed the basis of his second career delineating clerical life in small cathedral towns.</p><h2>Letters Concerning the English Nation (The World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>Inspired by Voltaire's two-year stay in England (1726-8), this is one of the key works of the Enlightenment.

As with other books in the Guide to Imagery series, the goal of this volume is to help contemporary art enthusiasts decode the symbolic meanings in the great masterworks of Western Art.<br> The first chapter traces the development of images of the Creation and the Afterworld from descriptions of them in the Scriptures through their evolution in later literary and philosophical works. The following two chapters examine artists' depictions of the two paths that humans may take, the path of evil or the path of salvation, and the punishments or rewards found on each. A chapter on the Judgment Day and the end of the world explores portrayals of the mysterious worlds between life and death and in the afterlife. Finally, the author looks at images of angelic and demonic beings themselves and how they came to be portrayed with the physical attributes--wings, halos, horns, and cloven hooves--with which we are now so familiar.<br> Thoroughly researched by and expert in the field of iconography, <em>Angels and Demons in Art</em> will delight readers with an interest in art or religious symbolism.</p><p><br><strong>Rosa Giorgi</strong> is an art historian specializing in iconography.

It's a big deal, after all, that a sitting senator was willing to write, "We must make the rescue of the environment the central organizing principle for civilization." And that's not all. In his 1992 book, Al Gore also wrote: <blockquote>I have become very impatient with my own tendency to put a finger to the political winds and proceed cautiously.... [E]very time I pause to consider whether I have gone too far out on a limb, I look at the new facts [on the environment crisis] that continue to pour in from around the world and conclude that I have not gone far enough.... [T]he time has long since come to take more political risks--and endure more political criticism--by proposing tougher, more effective solutions and fighting hard for their enactments.</blockquote><p> And the buzz on the street is that Gore actually wrote those words himself.</p><p> When <i>Earth in the Balance</i> first came out, it caused quite a stir--and for good reason. It convincingly makes the case that a crisis of epidemic proportions is nearly upon us and that if the world doesn't get its act together soon and agree to some kind of "Global Marshall Plan" to protect the environment, we're all up a polluted creek without a paddle. Myriad plagues are upon us, but the worst include the loss of biodiversity, the depletion of the ozone layer, the slash-and-burn destruction of rainforests, and the onset of global warming. None of this is new, of course, nor was it new in 1992. But most environmentalists will still get a giddy feeling reading such a call to action as written by a prominent politician.</p><p> The book is arranged into three sections: the first describes the plagues; the second looks at how we got ourselves into this mess; and the final chapters present ways out. Gore gets his points across in a serviceable way, though he could have benefited from a firmer editor's hand; at times the analogies are arcane and the pacing is odd--kind of like a Gore speech that climaxes at weird points and then sinks just as the audience is about to clap. Still, at the end you understand what's been said. Gore believes that if we apply some American ingenuity, the twin engines of democracy and capitalism can be rigged to help us stabilize world population growth, spread social justice, boost education levels, create environmentally appropriate technologies, and negotiate international agreements to bring us back from the brink. For example, a worldwide shift to clean, renewable energy sources would create huge economic opportunities for companies large and small to design, build, and maintain solar panels, wind turbines, fuel cells, and other ecofriendly innovations. </p><p> Gore doesn't mince words when describing just how hard it will be to get out of this jam. Real hope is contingent on a swelling up of concern among the public--and fast. A year into the vice presidency, in an interview with writer Bill McKibben, Gore paraphrased a key passage in his book, "The minimum that is scientifically necessary far exceeds the maximum that is politically feasible." Ah, a political out. Some readers will ask of Gore: what has he done since publishing his book to advance the political feasibility of decisive environmental action? <i>--Chip Giller</i></p>Vice President of the United States Al Gore has been a journalist, a state representative, and a senator.

Just as human cultures pass on languages and turns of phrase, tastes in food (and in how it is acquired), and modes of dress, could whales and dolphins have developed a culture of their very own?<br><br> Unequivocally: yes. In <i>The Cultural Lives of Whales and Dolphins</i>, cetacean biologists Hal Whitehead, who has spent much of his life on the ocean trying to understand whales, and Luke Rendell, whose research focuses on the evolution of social learning, open an astounding porthole onto the fascinating culture beneath the waves. As Whitehead and Rendell show, cetacean culture and its transmission are shaped by a blend of adaptations, innate sociality, and the unique environment in which whales and dolphins live: a watery world in which a hundred-and-fifty-ton blue whale can move with utter grace, and where the vertical expanse is as vital, and almost as vast, as the horizontal.<br><br> Drawing on their own research as well as a scientific literature as immense as the sea&#x2015;including evolutionary biology, animal behavior, ecology, anthropology, psychology, and neuroscience&#x2015;Whitehead and Rendell dive into realms both humbling and enlightening as they seek to define what cetacean culture is, why it exists, and what it means for the future of whales and dolphins. And, ultimately, what it means for our future, as well.</p><p><b>Hal Whitehead</b> is a University Research Professor in the Department of Biology at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and the author of <i>Sperm Whales: Social Evolution in the Ocean</i> and <i>Analyzing Animal Societies</i>, both published by the University of Chicago Press.

Whitehead and Rendell are two such people, for our own time. Perhaps it is something to do with the enigmatic beauty of the animals they study. Or perhaps their own brains are better evolved than the rest of ours. Whatever the reason, this book is an astonishing, unconstrained exploration of the nature and practice of cetacean culture.&nbsp;Placing it side by side with human culture, the authors show that the expression of ideas is not limited to humans or primates. Exciting, witty, with its finger&#x2014;or should that be flipper?&#x2014;ever on the pulse, wearing its profundity with a wonderful lightness of touch, <i>The Cultural Lives of Whales and Dolphins</i> is a revolutionary book.

This is precisely why, Whitehead and Rendell argue in their new book <i>The Cultural Lives of Whales and Dolphins</i>, just like us, knowledge is also a vital currency for these marine mammals. . . . At times it is a humorous journey through aspects of human behaviour and &#x2018;decision making,&#x2019; resulting as it does from cultural pressures. But this apparent irreverence is not without deeper meaning and strong intent. . . . They provide some sobering insights into those ubiquitous cultural forces that shape us all into modern human beings and at times can leave you reeling with questions about your own free will. This is an exceptional book; it will no doubt irritate some anthropologist who believe that culture is the domain of humans alone; it may even rile some theologians; but far, far more importantly it will help to bridge the gap between humans and other species, speaking as it does to the evolutionary continuum and demonstrating with sound scientific evidence that there are some extraordinary non-human cultures being played out in the natural world. . . .

The question is, will we get the message?&#x201d; (Philippa Brakes, Whale and Dolphin Conservation <i>Huffington Post UK</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Humans, though arguably the masters of culture, are not the only species that has it. Dolphins, as the authors reveal, create signature whistles and can mimic and remember others&#x2019; even twenty years later. They can also learn tail-walking in captivity and then teach it in the wild. Whales possess dialects that change in a way that can only be explained as the result of learning. And both whales and dolphins behave in &#x2018;obviously altruistic&#x2019; ways. Dolphins and whales have saved humans stranded at sea, and humpback whales have been observed saving seals from killer whales. . . . Whitehead and Rendell deeply analyze the importance of culture to evolution, exploring what can be learned from animals that are perhaps more advanced than humans before pushing &#x2018;off to sea again, where there is still so much to learn.&#x2019;&#x201d; (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been anxiously waiting for <i>The Cultural Lives of Whales and Dolphins</i> to arrive and consumed it last night and early this morning.

Also discussed are the implications of the creatures&#x2019; culture as it relates to ecosystems and conservation and the future of the cetacean world, including what it bodes for humans. . . .

Greenleaf said the answer is "Yes." <p>Practicing Servant-Leadership brings together a group of exceptional thinkers who offer a compendium of thought on the topic of bringing servant-leadership into the daily lives of leaders. Each contributor focuses on his or her area of expertise, exploring how servant-leadership works in the real world, using examples from a variety of organizations such as businesses, nonprofits, churches, schools, foundations, and leadership organizations. Highlights of the book&#x2019;s twelve essays include</p> <ul> <li>How the idealistic vision of the servant as leader works even in the competitive world of business</li> <li>Encouraging leaders to begin by looking at what they themselves want to become and then to bring this knowledge into their daily leadership</li> <li>How the principles of servant-leadership can enhance our understanding and practice of philanthropy</li> <li>Examining the board chairperson&#x2019;s especially vital role as a servant- leader</li> <li>Revealing the important role that religious congregations and seminaries can play in helping to hold organizations in trust around the exercise of their power and prerogative</li> <li>Exploring what leaders learn from being followers</li> </ul> <p>Those new to servant-leadership will find Practicing Servant-Leadership a practical guide to the model, and those already familiar with the model will find new practical application and inspiration.</p></p><h2>Duets for Strings, Book 1, Violin (Belwin Course for Strings, Bk 1)</h2><p>The Duets for Strings, Book 1 may be started when the pupil has reached page 9 of Book 1 of the String Builder.

The ability to interchange text, audio, and visual communication over the Internet has fundamentally transformed the way news organizations operate. Convergence has enabled media companies to gather, disseminate, and share information over a variety of platforms. Throughout the history of journalism, it has been common for journalists to study one medium, such as traditional print or broadcast, and to anticipate a career working only in their chosen field. However, the 21st century journalist has fluidity to write and deliver news content in a variety of formats. (source: http://www.convergencejournalism.com/)<br><b>Broadcast News Writing, Reporting, and Producing</b> presents a solid foundation for any student learning how to become a broadcast journalist ? in today's world of convergent journalism, it is more important than ever that broadcast textbooks cover the most current trends in media.

The new edition will be rewritten and restructured to accommodate common 16-week course modules, and will be divided into four major sections of the news: gathering, writing, reporting, and producing. Sidebars featuring how examples used in the text relate to convergence in journalism help students to draw connections easily between current stories and trends in the industry. <br><br>The comprehensive approach of this text brings a multi-faceted perspective of writing, reporting, and producing that is needed more than ever in today's world of convergent journalism.

Composed of simple interacting agents, this intelligence lies in the networks of interactions among individuals and between individuals and the environment. A fascinating subject, social insects are also a powerful metaphor for artificial intelligence, and the problems they solve--finding food, dividing labor among nestmates, building nests, responding to external challenges--have important counterparts in engineering and computer science. <br> <br>This book provides a detailed look at models of social insect behavior and how to apply these models in the design of complex systems. The book shows how these models replace an emphasis on control, preprogramming, and centralization with designs featuring autonomy, emergence, and distributed functioning. These designs are proving immensely flexible and robust, able to adapt quickly to changing environments and to continue functioning even when individual elements fail. In particular, these designs are an exciting approach to the tremendous growth of complexity in software and information. <em>Swarm Intelligence</em> draws on up-to-date research from biology, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, robotics, operations research, and computer graphics, and each chapter is organized around a particular biological example, which is then used to develop an algorithm, a multiagent system, or a group of robots. The book will be an invaluable resource for a broad range of disciplines.<br></p><p>Eric Bonabeau is at Santa Fe Institute.

Siegel was born in the Bronx in 1947. While living on Jerome Avenue and attending City College of New York (CCNY) in the 1960s, he was swept up in the social and political currents of the time. He became intrigued with the influence contemporary culture had on individual behavior: Did people shape society or did society shape people? He applied his interest in social forces and human behavior to the study of crime and justice. After graduating from CCNY, he attended the newly opened program in criminal justice at the State University of New York at Albany, earning both his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees there. After completing his graduate work, Dr. Siegel began his teaching career at Northeastern University, where he was a faculty member for nine years. After leaving Northeastern, he held teaching positions at the University of Nebraska-Omaha and Saint Anselm College in New Hampshire. He then taught in the School of Criminology and Justice Studies at the University of Massachusetts-Lowell for more than 26 years. Now a Professor Emeritus, he continues to teach online courses. Dr. Siegel has written extensively in the area of crime and justice, including books on juvenile law, delinquency, criminology, criminal justice, and criminal procedure.

From the transcription of the Old Testament to Greek, to the collection of the Gospels, the Bible has always been in a state of literary and scholarly transition. In her classic work, <i>The Study of the Bible in the Middle Ages</i>, Beryl Smalley describes the changes in the organization, technique, and purpose of Bible studies in northwestern Europe from the Carolingian renaissance to about 1300. This was the period when the emergence of Aristotelian thought inspired medieval scholars to take a fresh look at the Scriptures. The large number of medieval commentaries on the Bible confirms that they did so and that they expressed their reactions in writing. Medieval historians and students of literature will find special value in this book: they will learn, in systematic fashion, what earlier scholars have accomplished in the field of exegesis; and they will be enabled to employ the history of biblical interpretation recounted here as a mirror for the social and cultural upheavals that were taking place simultaneously.</p><p>Beryl Smalley (1905&#x2013;1984) was a British historian. She was a tutor in history and former vice-Principal at St. Hilda&#x2019;s College, Oxford.</p><h2>Prentice Hall's Comprehensive Review For NCLEX-RN: Reviews &amp; Rationales</h2><p>Great comprehensive NCLEX-RN review.

But what was it truly like to be a woman during this era?&nbsp;</strong></p> The Tudor period conjures up images of queens and noblewomen in elaborate court dress; of palace intrigue and dramatic politics. But if you were a woman, it was also a time when death during childbirth was rife; when marriage was usually a legal contract, not a matter for love, and the education you could hope to receive was minimal at best.<br><br> Yet the Tudor century was also dominated by powerful and dynamic women in a way that no era had been before. Historian Elizabeth Norton explores the life cycle of the Tudor woman, from childhood to old age, through the diverging examples of women such as Elizabeth Tudor, Henry VIII&#x2019;s sister; Cecily Burbage, Elizabeth's wet nurse; Mary Howard, widowed but influential at court; Elizabeth Boleyn, mother of a controversial queen; and Elizabeth Barton, a peasant girl who would be lauded as a prophetess. Their stories are interwoven with studies of topics ranging from Tudor toys to contraception to witchcraft, painting a portrait of the lives of queens and serving maids, nuns and harlots, widows and chaperones. Norton brings this vibrant period to colorful life in an evocative and insightful social history. 8 pages of color illustrations</p><p>Elizabeth Norton is a historian specializing in the queens of England and the Tudor period.

Dressed in cowboy duds and prepared for life in the rugged desert, these characters are more than any coyote bargained for.</p><p>Text: SpanishGrade 2-4?In this humorous Southwestern variant of the familiar story, three desert javelinas (hairy cousins to the ordinary pig) set off one day to seek their fortunes. The first makes his home from a pile of tumbleweeds. Soon after, Coyote arrives and effortlessly blows it away to get at the plump little creature. Shaken, the portly javelina runs to his brother's house, which is built from the sticks of a dried saguaro cactus. Coyote, as sneaky as he is quick, demolishes that shaky structure and sends two frightened javelinas running into the desert. The brothers eventually find refuge in the home of their sister. This smart little javelina has constructed her home out of sturdy adobe bricks. Unable to huff and a puff his way in, Coyote tries entering through the stove pipe on the roof. When sister javelina realizes what he is up to, she quickly lights her pot-belly stove and sends Coyote howling into the desert (an action he repeats to this day). This engaging retelling appears in both Spanish and English, and has many accurate regional details. The text is fast-paced and witty in both languages, and is accompanied by energetic, full-page illustrations done in rich earthy tones that evoke the setting as faithfully as the text. Whether read aloud or in amused solitude, this is a picture book that will be enjoyed again and again.?Donna J.

This in-depth study of writing pedagogy looks at many challenges facing both instructors and students in college composition classes, and offers a thorough and refreshing exploration of writing experience, ability, and rhetorical situation.&nbsp;<br><br>Soliday provides an overview of the contemporary theory and research in Writing across the Curriculum programs, focusing specifically on the implementation of the Writing Fellows Program at the City College of New York. Drawing on her direct observations of colleagues and students at the school, she addresses the everyday challenges that novice writers face, such as developing an appropriate "stance" in one's writing, and the intricacies of choosing and developing content.&nbsp;<br><br>The volume then goes on to address some of the most pressing questions being asked by teachers of composition: To what extent can writing be separated from its situation? How can rhetorical expertise be shared across fields? And to what degree is writing ability local rather than general? Soliday argues that, while writing is closely connected to situation, general rhetorical principles can still be capably applied if those situations are known. The key to improving writing instruction, she maintains, is to construct contexts that expose writers to the social actions that genres perform for readers.&nbsp;<br><br>Supplementing the author's case study are six appendixes, complete with concrete examples and helpful teaching tools to establish effective classroom practices and exercises in Writing across the Curriculum programs. Packed with useful information and insight, Everyday Genres is an essential volume for both students and teachers seeking to expand their understanding of the nature of writing.</p><p>Mary Soliday is a professor of English and the director of Writing across the Curriculum and in the Disciplines at San Francisco State University.

For more than 30 years, Creative Time has been an avatar of public art in the city, working to engage art and the environment, artists and the public. <i>Creative Time: The Book</i> shows how a single organization made it possible for thousands of artists to present awe-inspiring works that engage, taunt, seduce, enliven, and transform a city. Creative Time artworks have been seen in spaces both lofty and modest. Light projections have appeared on the Beaux-Arts entrance to the New York Public Library and from Ground Zero in the now famous Tribute in Light Memorial to 9/11. Signage has popped up on Times Square's Astrovision screen and along the boardwalks of Coney Island. Music has blasted in Central Park as well as under tunnels in DUMBO, Brooklyn. Creative Time's community includes many of the world's most dynamic, emerging, and established artists, among them Vito Acconci, Doug Aitken, Laurie Anderson, Diller + Scofidio, David Byrne, Felix Gonzalez-Torres, Cai Guo-Qiang, Jenny Holzer, Ryan McGinness, Vik Muniz, Takashi Murakami, Shirin Neshat, Sonic Youth, and William Wegman. <p>In more than 300 images from the hilarious to the elegiac this dazzling volume highlights the best and most innovative work from the organization's 33 years. Contributors to the volume are among the most important voices in the field of public art. Their commentary collectively shapes this must-have book for anyone interested in contemporary art or in the unapologetically diverse heartbeat of New York. In keeping with Creative Time's innovative spirit, the book itself is the result of a public art installation. Each cover is unique: a tip-on displays the colors, sound, and weather in New York recorded over a two-week period.</p></p><p>Anne Pasternak is president and artistic director of Creative Time.During its 33-year history, Creative Time has produced 313 public art projects involving 1,361 artists in New York City. This book, which is dense with text and photographs, both celebrates that achievement and assesses the current state of public art. Creative Time has dedicated itself to a concept of public art that is temporary and experimental rather than permanent and monumental. In the late 1970s, the group was known for taking over empty real estate, whether a building lobby or a landfill. In the 1980s, at a time of rising political activism, they were likely to insert art onto street corners, the sides of buses, milk cartons or takeout coffee cups. One project in 1993 took over all of 42nd Street before its final Disneyfication. In 2004 Creative Time deployed a team of artists to repaint the facades of businesses at Coney Island. The 21 contributors to this book include critics, curators, artists, novelists and the three people who have helmed the organization. Their essays and interviews offer an entertaining and sometimes nostalgic look at three decades of the New York art scene. The book will interest those involved with public art in cities nationwide. 275 color and 25 b&amp;w illus. <i>(May 1)</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Written in a unique, lyrical Aramaic, this masterpiece of Kabbalah exceeds the dimensions of a normal book; it is virtually a body of literature, comprising over twenty discrete sections. The bulk of the <i>Zohar</i> consists of a fascinating mystical commentary on the Torah, from Genesis through Deuteronomy.</p> <p>This sixth volume of <i>The Zohar: Pritzker Edition</i> completes the <i>Zohar's</i> commentary on the book of Exodus. Some of the volume focuses on the Dwelling (or <i>mishkan</i>) built by Moses and the Israelites in the Sinai Desert. The <i>mishkan</i> symbolizes <i>Shekhinah</i>, the feminine presence of God who "dwells" on earth. The construction of the <i>mishkan</i> is intended to ensure Her intimacy with the people&#x2015;and especially with Moses, who is actually called Her husband.</p> <p>The dramatic episode of the Golden Calf receives special treatment. The worship of the calf is seen as a rejection of <i>Shekhinah</i>. Normally, She would have restrained the wrath of God's masculine aspect and prevented Him from striking Israel; but having been rejected, She instead departed, leaving the people vulnerable. Whereupon the blessed Holy One hinted to Moses that it was up to him to defend Israel from divine destruction. By invoking the three patriarchs, Moses pinned God's arms, as it were, and immobilized Him, saving his people.</p> <p>With the appearance of this volume, <i>The Zohar: Pritzker Edition</i> has reached its halfway point. The projected Volumes VII-IX will complete the <i>Zohar's</i> main commentary on the Torah. Volumes X-XII will include the <i>Zohar's</i> commentary on various other books of the Bible (such as Ruth and Song of Songs) as well as several independent compositions.</p></p><p>Daniel C.

Perhaps first and foremost, they were also anxious tobacco farmers, harried by a demanding planting cycle, trans-Atlantic shipping risks, and their uneasy relations with English agents. George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and their contemporaries lived in a world that was dominated by questions of debt from across an ocean but also one that stressed personal autonomy.</p><br><p> T. H. Breen's study of this tobacco culture focuses on how elite planters gave meaning to existence. He examines the value-laden relationships--found in both the fields and marketplaces--that led from tobacco to politics, from agrarian experience to political protest, and finally to a break with the political and economic system that they believed threatened both personal independence and honor.</p></p><p>T. H. Breen is the William Smith Mason Professor of American History at Northwestern University.Why did Virginia's great Tidewater planters figure so prominently in the movement for independence? A good part of the reason, according to Breen, is found in the values of personal honor and autonomy that the tobacco planters' culture promoted. Growing indebtedness to English merchants, which threatened such values, made many especially susceptible to ``Radical Country thought.'' Rejecting the purely economic interpretation of the Progressive historians, and going beyond the ``idealist'' explanation of Bernard Baylin, Breen skillfully details the ``complex interplay between ideology and experience.'' A rich, balanced, and judicious work that breaks new ground in the study of the American Revolution. For informed laypersons and scholars. Roy H.

Set in fin-de-siï¿½cle Austria&#x2015;the cafï¿½s, salons, and musical concerts frequented by the Viennese elite&#x2015;Schnitzler's perceptive exploration of the creative process and the private lives and public aspirations of urban Jewish intellectuals ranks with the highest achievements of Karl Kraus and Robert Musil.<br><br>The novel's central character, Baron Georg von Wergenthin, is a handsome young composer whose troubled relations with women, musical collaborators, and representatives of the old social order make Schnitzler's book a revealing investigation of individual psychology and social allegory. In his comprehensive introduction, Russell Berman situates the book within the literary and political history of Central Europe and analyzes its relation to psychoanalysis, Marxism, musical aesthetics, and the legacy of European modernism.</p><p>"One of the most important, representative, revelatory works of Austria at the turn of the century. . . .

Introductions to individual plays include information on authors as well as overviews of cultural contexts, major ideas and performance history.<br>Dramaturgical techniques in the plays draw on Western theatre as well as local performance traditions and include agit-prop dialogue, musical routines, storytelling, ritual incantation, epic narration, dance, multimedia presentation and puppetry. The plays dramatize diverse issues, such as:<br>*globalization<br>* political corruption<br>* race and class relations<br>*slavery<br>*gender and sexuality<br>*media representation<br>*nationalism</p><p>Helen Gilbert lectures in Drama and Theatre Studies at the University of Queensland. She is co-author of <em>Post Colonial Drama: Theory, Practice and Politics.</em>British and American colonialism's impact on native cultures is vividly reflected in this unique anthology of dramatic works from Africa, Canada, India, Southeast Asia, the Caribbean, Northern Ireland, and the South Pacific. The individual pieces present a variety of dramatic techniques, ranging from the monolog to puppet plays to storytelling and multimedia presentations, as they examine, often painfully, how a native population must come to terms with its colonial "masters." For example, the first piece, "Pink," is a powerful monolog evoking the painful reality of South African apartheid as it affects a ten-year-old white girl and her native maid. Each play is preceded by an author biography and other contextual information regarding its performance history and themes. Gilbert (drama and theater studies, Univ. of Queensland, Australia) is coauthor of Post Colonial Drama: Theory, Practice, and Politics and author of Sightlines.

Icons indicate which recipes are spicy; can be made ahead; cooked in the microwave; in one pot; or are ready in under 30 minutes. If there's a diehard meat-and-potatoes person in the house, add some extra spice or a touch more fat to these recipes and they will please everyone at the table; in fact, the dishes in this book may seduce others who need to lose weight into joining you in a healthful regimen.Versatile Vegetarian Although you're probably eating more chicken, fish, pasta and rice instead of the meat-and-potatoes fare you grew up on, making a more dramatic change in your eating habits can be downright daunting. You know what you should eat, but how&#x2014;how to prepare these unfamiliar foods, how to plan a meatless meal, how to make sure it's flavorful, how to get your family to eat tofu&#x2014;is a mystery. In Weight Watchers Versatile Vegetarian, you'll find 150 recipes that are healthful, easy-to-prepare and reassuringly similiar to the meat-based dishes your family loves.

In the second, he explains how Chinese, European-Americans in Yellowface, and various caricatures became objects of curiosity in the expansive commercial marketplace.

As a distinctive and particularly intense variety of early modern Reformed Protestantism, it was a product of acute tensions within the post-Reformation Church of England. But it was never monolithic or purely oppositional, and its impact reverberated far beyond seventeenth-century England and New England. This Companion broadens our understanding of Puritanism, showing how students and scholars might engage with it from new angles and uncover the surprising diversity that fermented beneath its surface. The book explores issues of gender, literature, politics and popular culture in addition to addressing the Puritans&#39; core concerns such as theology and devotional praxis, and coverage extends to Irish, Welsh, Scottish and European versions of Puritanism as well as to English and American practice. It challenges readers to re-evaluate this crucial tradition within its wider social, cultural, political and religious contexts.</p><p>&#39;Puritan&#39; was originally a term of contempt, and Puritanism is still often interpreted as a uniform, primarily religious phenomenon, confined to seventeenth-century England and colonial America.

In the &#x201c;dispute of the New World&#x201d; many historians, naturalists, and moral philosophers from Europe and the Americas (including Thomas Jefferson) sought either to confirm or refute Buffon&#x2019;s views. This book maintains that the &#x201c;dispute&#x201d; was also a debate over historical authority: upon whose sources and facts should naturalists and historians reconstruct the history of the continent and its peoples?</p> <p>The author traces the cultural processes that led early-modern intellectuals on both sides of the Atlantic to question primary sources that had long been considered authoritative: Mesoamerican codices, early colonial Spanish chronicles, and travel accounts. In the process, he demonstrates how the writings of these critics led to the rise of the genre of conjectural history. The book also adds to the literature on nation formation by exploring the creation of specific identities in Spain and Spanish America by means of particular historical narratives and institutions. Finally, it demonstrates that colonial intellectuals went beyond mirroring or contesting European ideas and put forth daring and original critiques of European epistemologies that resulted in substantially new historiographical concepts.</p></p><p>&#x201c;In view of the breakthrough represented by the achievements of this book, strikingly heterodox and impressively persuasive interpretations of the &#x2018;dispute of the New World,&#x2019; it is of cardinal importance in several fields of history: Latin America, the Spanish monarchy, Enlightenment, historiography, and New World cultural encounters.&#x201d;&#x2014;Felipe Fernï¿½ndez-Armesto, Oxford University<br>&#x201c;Refreshes our understanding of the colonial past and of the origins of the independence movements in the New World.

Both texts - with and without Percy&#39;s interventions - are presented in this edition.</p><p><i>Frankenstein,</i> loved by many decades of readers and praised by such eminent literary critics as Harold Bloom, seems hardly to need a recommendation. If you haven't read it recently, though, you may not remember the sweeping force of the prose, the grotesque, surreal imagery, and the multilayered <i>doppelgï¿½nger</i> themes of Mary Shelley's masterpiece. As fantasy writer Jane Yolen writes of this (the reviewer's favorite) edition, "The strong black and whites of the main text [illustrations] are dark and brooding, with unremitting shadows and stark contrasts. But the central conversation with the monster--who owes nothing to the overused movie image ... but is rather the novel's charnel-house composite--is where [Barry] Moser's illustrations show their greatest power ... The viewer can all but smell the powerful stench of the monster's breath as its words spill out across the page. Strong book-making for one of the world's strongest and most remarkable books."

Mineral treasures that took millions, or even billions, of years to form are now being squandered in just centuries&#x2013;or sometimes just decades. <br> <br> Will there come a time when we actually run out of minerals? Debates already soar over how we are going to obtain energy without oil, coal, and gas. But what about the other mineral losses we face? Without metals, and semiconductors, how are we going to keep our industrial system running? Without mineral fertilizers and fuels, how are we going to produce the food we need?<br> <br> Ugo Bardi delivers a sweeping history of the mining industry, starting with its humble beginning when our early ancestors started digging underground to find the stones they needed for their tools. He traces the links between mineral riches and empires, wars, and civilizations, and shows how mining in its various forms came to be one of the largest global industries. He also illustrates how the gigantic mining machine is now starting to show signs of difficulties. The easy mineral resources, the least expensive to extract and process, have been mostly exploited and depleted. There are plenty of minerals left to extract, but at higher costs and with increasing difficulties.<br> <br> The effects of depletion take different forms and one may be the economic crisis that is gripping the world system. And depletion is not the only problem. Mining has a dark side&#x2013;pollution&#x2013;that takes many forms and delivers many consequences, including climate change.&nbsp; <br> <br> The world we have been accustomed to, so far, was based on cheap mineral resources and on the ability of the ecosystem to absorb pollution without generating damage to human beings. Both conditions are rapidly disappearing. Having thoroughly plundered planet Earth, we are entering a new world. <br> <br> Bardi draws upon the world&#x2019;s leading minerals experts to offer a compelling glimpse into that new world ahead.</p></p><p><p>Ugo Bardi is a member of the Department of Earth Sciences at the University of Florence, where he teaches physical chemistry.

Yet, according to Italian chemistry professor and ecological expert Bardi, who wrote this report for the Club of Rome, a global think tank devoted to addressing political and humanitarian concerns, worldwide mineral depletion not only impacts climate change but strains the international economy and often harms the indigenous cultures where mining takes place. After taking readers through a tour of mineral mining&#x2019;s colorful history, Bardi explains the multistage process of bringing minerals to market, from extraction to refinement, before addressing mining&#x2019;s dark side, including reckless waste and child labor in Third World countries. With input from other mineral experts, Bardi also rebuts critics who argue that emerging technologies, like a &#x2018;universal mining machine,' will be able to solve most of these problems. A skillfully written guide to a crucial, little-understood subject and an urgent wake-up call.&#x201d;</p><br><br><p><em><strong>Publishers Weekly-</strong></em></p> <p>"Our massive global mining infrastructure is showing signs of strain, writes Bardi (<em>The Limits of Growth Revisited</em>), University of Florence professor of chemistry, in this insightful if pessimistic description of the industry&#x2019;s history, operation, and future. All mined minerals including carbon (coal, oil, gas) are unrenewable resources whose supply is already dwindling. Sadly, as with global warming, there are skeptics and denialists who insist that (a) it&#x2019;s not true, and (b) technology will fix matters. These same opponents state, correctly, that we have extracted a minuscule fraction of the oil, iron, or even gold in the earth&#x2019;s crust. But they ignore that, as ore quality diminishes and extracting becomes harder, the price rises. For example, platinum (essential in catalytic converters), silver, and oil cost four times more than in the year 2000. They also assume that technology will produce a 'universal mining machine,' which will consume ordinary rock, extracting whatever is valuable. Although theoretically possible, such a machine would require immense amounts of energy and leave behind unthinkable quantities of waste. Bardi concludes that things must change, and though his is not an encouraging book, readers will appreciate his intelligent, lucid, and disturbing account of our mishandling of mineral resources.&#x201d;</p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Ugo Bardi&#x2019;s book is an effective piece of work for stimulating thought and&nbsp;debate on this planet&#x2019;s mineral wealth, and how we should view this issue&nbsp;within the framework of sustainability.

This guide presents a comprehensive critical look at this important work, delving into both its literary significance and social impact.</p><p>Bigger Thomas is doomed, trapped in a downward spiral that will lead to arrest, prison, or death, driven by despair, frustration, poverty, and incomprehension. As a young black man in the Chicago of the '30s, he has no way out of the walls of poverty and racism that surround him, and after he murders a young white woman in a moment of panic, these walls begin to close in. There is no help for him--not from his hapless family; not from liberal do-gooders or from his well-meaning yet naive friend Jan; certainly not from the police, prosecutors, or judges. Bigger is debased, aggressive, dangerous, and a violent criminal. As such, he has no claim upon our compassion or sympathy. And yet...<p> A more compelling story than <i>Native Son</i> has not been written in the 20th century by an American writer. That is not to say that Richard Wright created a novel free of flaws, but that he wrote the first novel that successfully told the most painful and unvarnished truth about American social and class relations. As Irving Howe asserted in 1963, "The day <i>Native Son</i> appeared, American culture was changed forever. It made impossible a repetition of the old lies [and] brought out into the open, as no one ever had before, the hatred, fear and violence that have crippled and may yet destroy our culture."</p><p> Other books had focused on the experience of growing up black in America--including Wright's own highly successful <i>Uncle Tom's Children</i>, a collection of five stories that focused on the victimization of blacks who transgressed the code of racial segregation. But they suffered from what he saw as a kind of lyrical idealism, setting up sympathetic black characters in oppressive situations and evoking the reader's pity. In <i>Native Son</i>, Wright was aiming at something more. In Bigger, he created a character so damaged by racism and poverty, with dreams so perverted, and with human sensibilities so eroded, that he has no claim on the reader's compassion: </p><blockquote>"I didn't want to kill," Bigger shouted. "But what I killed for, I am! It must've been pretty deep in me to make me kill! I must have felt it awful hard to murder.... What I killed for must've been good!" Bigger's voice was full of frenzied anguish. "It must have been good! When a man kills, it's for something... I didn't know I was really alive in this world until I felt things hard enough to kill for 'em. It's the truth..."</blockquote> Wright's genius was that, in preventing us from feeling pity for Bigger, he forced us to confront the hopelessness, misery, and injustice of the society that gave birth to him. <i>--Andrew Himes</i><p>Right from the start, Bigger Thomas had been headed for jail. It could have been for assault or petty larceny; by chance, it was for murder and rape. <em>Native Son</em> tells the story of this young black man caught in a downward spiral after he kills a young white woman in a brief moment of panic. Set in Chicago in the 1930s, Wright's powerful novel is an unsparing reflection on the poverty and feelings of hopelessness experienced by people in inner cities across the country and of what it means to be black in America.</p></p><h2>Electronics Principles and Applications with Student Data CD-Rom</h2><p>The eighth edition of Electronics: Principles and Applications is based on the same philosophy of previous editions.

But according to Diane Ravitch, a leading historian of education, what began with the best of intentions has veered toward bizarre extremes. At a time when we celebrate and encourage diversity, young readers are fed bowdlerized texts, devoid of the references that give these works their meaning and vitality. With forceful arguments and sensible solutions for rescuing American education from the pressure groups that have made classrooms bland and uninspiring, <b>The Language Police</b><i> </i>offers a powerful corrective to a cultural scandal.</p><p>The impulse in the 1960s and &#x2018;70s to achieve fairness and a balanced perspective in our nation&#x2019;s textbooks and standardized exams was undeniably necessary and commendable. Then how could it have gone so terribly wrong? Acclaimed education historian Diane Ravitch answers this question in her informative and alarming book, <i>The Language Police: How Pressure Groups Restrict What Students Learn</i>. Author of 7 books, Ravitch served as the U.S. Assistant Secretary of Education from 1991 to 1993. Her expertise and her 30-year commitment to education lend authority and urgency to this important book, which describes in copious detail how pressure groups from the political right and left have wrested control of the language and content of textbooks and standardized exams, often at the expense of the truth (in the case of history), of literary quality (in the case of literature), and of education in general. Like most people involved in education, Ravitch did not realize "that educational materials are now governed by an intricate set of rules to screen out language and topics that might be considered controversial or offensive." In this clear-eyed critique, she is an unapologetic challenger of the ridiculous and damaging extremes to which bias guidelines and sensitivity training have been taken by the federal government, the states, and textbook publishers. <p></p> In a multi-page sampling of rejected test passages, we discover that "in the new meaning of bias, it its considered biased to acknowledge that lack of sight is a disability," that children who live in urban areas cannot understand passages about the country, that the Aesop fable about a vain (female) fox and a flattering (male) crow promotes gender bias. As outrageous as many of the examples are, they do not appear particularly dangerous. However, as the illustrations of abridgment, expurgation, and bowdlerization mount, the reader begins to understand that our educational system is indeed facing a monumental crisis of distortion and censorship. Ravitich ends her book with three suggestions of how to counter this disturbing tendency. Sadly, however, in the face of the overwhelming tide of misinformation that has already been entrenched in the system, her suggestions provide cold comfort. <i>--Silvana Tropea</i>&#x201c;Lucid, forceful, written with insight, passion, compassion and conviction, <b><i>The Language Police</i></b> is not only hair-raisingly readable but deeply reasonable. It should be required reading not only for parents, teachers and educators, but for everyone who cares about history, literature, science, culture and indeed the civilization in which we live.&#x201d; --Merle Rubin, <i>Los Angeles Times</i><br><br>&#x201c;Revealing and important...

The lead essay, on art dealer Theo van Gogh, gives an affecting portrait of Theo encouraging his solitary brother Vincent to build up an entourage of supportive artists and friends. Through Gauguin's acrimonious letters to dealer Ambroise Vollard, we see how Vollard's negligence, procrastination and extremely low prices helped undermine Gauguin's last reserves of strength. "Seurat: The Meaning of the Dots" explains that the Pointillist considered the color dots he used a mere byproduct of his theories of light; an essay on Odilon Redon shows us that this visionary, abruptly adopted by the Symbolists after decades of neglect, remained as aloof and independent as ever. In a survey of the Fauves, Rewald describes how Dufy, Marquet and others took a cue from Matisse in unleashing violent emotions with subtle control. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Tapping the Healer Within : Using Thought Field Therapy to Instantly Conquer Your Fears, Anxieties, and Emotional Distress</h2><p>Explains how to utilize the healing principles of Thought Field Therapy (TFT) to overcome emotional problems, defeat fear and anxiety, alleviate phobias, conquer addictions, and deal with other psychological problems through a system that uses energy points throughout the body to release distress.</p><p>A revolution is brewing in modern psychology, and it has already changed the way that hundreds of therapists have treated thousands of their clients.

It covers the transition from the relatively diverse world of Roman Empire in late antiquity to the disparate world of early medieval Europe--where local differences assumed far greater significance, but where the institution of Latin Christianity lent coherence to the successor states. In this book, McKitterick and five other leading historians have collaborated closely to produce a set of thematic interpretations covering politics, society, economy, culture, religion, and Europe and the wider world. Military matters and warfare are treated within these chapters, reflecting their entrenchment in social, economic, and political structures. The definition of 'Europe' is ambiguous in this period, but for the most part 'Europe' coincides with the ever-expanding horizons of Latin Christendom. It also looks at crucial interactions with other areas, such as Scandinavia, eastern Europe, the Islamic Middle East and North Africa, and Byzantium. Providing a coherent view of the most important elements within the period, this book gives a sense of the complexities and excitements of six hundred years of transition.<br></p><p>Rosamond McKitterick is at Newnham College, Cambridge.</p><h2>Douglas McGregor, Revisited: Managing the Human Side of the Enterprise</h2><p>The words of Douglas McGregor, one of the fore-fathers of management theory and one of the top business thinkers of all time, cannot and should not be ignored. McGregor's vision of a more humanistic workplace may not have been widely accepted over three decades ago, but technological advancements that McGregor himself anticipated have paradoxically helped companies become more human. Viewing employees not as cogs in the machine but as living beings with individual goals-what McGregor called "the human side of the enterprise"-has proven to provide a remarkable competitive advantage.<br> Now, with the rise of the networked economy, the growing power of frontline workers, and the shift in power from mass producer to individual consumer, authors Gary Heil, Warren Bennis, and Deborah Stephens assert that McGregor's ideas are more important and relevant than ever before.<br> Douglas McGregor, Revisited emphasizes McGregor's lasting influence and updates his thinking with new concepts, fresh strategies, and modern implementation. This timely work traces McGregor's original thinking, which has emerged in current approaches that stress distributed leadership, open-minded appraisal techniques, and employee/customer commitment.<br> Highlighted throughout with gems of wisdom in McGregor's own words, the book describes the value of his theories for today's managers. The authors carefully outline how to put McGregor's thinking into practice in your own business so you can:<br> * Devise a better performance management system<br> * Form and supervise effective management teams<br> * Build cooperation instead of internal competition<br> * Cultivate an intrinsically motivating, values-driven workplace<br> * Create a cause worthy of employee commitment<br> Also featured are examples from a host of companies and leaders who have flourished under McGregor's approach. Authoritative and highly instructive, Douglas McGregor, Revisited offers new generations of managers important lessons from history and from the field.<br> Praise for Douglas McGregor, Revisited<br> "This book revisits in a contemporary manner the most important question facing management today: given what we know about human nature, how should work be managed so as to unleash the vast creative potential of human beings? The evidence is overwhelming that many people either come to an organization or can be appropriately led to exhibit the behavior McGregor characterized as 'Theory Y.' This book provides a 'how-to' approach for developing people at work and for establishing high performance organizations."-Joseph A. Maciariello, Horton Professor of Management<br> Peter F. Drucker Graduate School of Management, Claremont Graduate University and Claremont McKenna College. Author of Lasting Value: Lessons from a Century of Agility at Lincoln Electric<br> Douglas McGregor's seminal works, The Human Side of the Enterprise and The Professional Manager, debunked Taylorism and described a revolutionary way to manage people. He was the first to apply the findings in behavioral science to the world of business. Based on what had been learned about human behavior, McGregor explored the implications of managing people in a different manner than tradition dictated.<br> The nature of work today makes McGregor's ideas more relevant than ever before. This important book applies his thinking to today's business world, proving again that the human aspect of work is crucial to organizational effectiveness. It also suggests how you can change your thinking and implement his ideas in your own business and workplace.</p><p>Now that we've been downsized and outsourced and reengineered and networked, management gurus are finally focusing on the one universal resource that has been staring them in the face all along: their so-called "human capital." The funny thing is, some of the best thinking on the subject was published more than four decades ago, when few senior business people were ready to listen. In essays like "New Concepts of Management" and books like <i>The Human Side of Enterprise</i>, the late MIT educator Douglas McGregor argued articulately that corporations are not merely machines, nor are workers simply cogs to run them. Now, in <i>Douglas McGregor, Revisited</i>, Gary Heil, Warren G. Bennis, and Deborah C. Stephens resurrect many of these prescient observations and place them in a context appropriate for our times. The three prominent leadership specialists open with "Why McGregor Matters," an extensive section in which his opinions are discussed as they relate to performance, cooperation, motivation, commitment, and other topics like teams. The authors conclude with selections from McGregor's work that address issues (including the changing composition of the industrial work force, job satisfaction, and paternalism) that remain as relevant today as the day they were written. --<i>Howard Rothman</i>GARY HEIL and DEBORAH C.

The richness of Mr. Johns's book lies in the splendid detail he has collected to describe the world of books in the first two centuries after the printing press arrived in England."&#x2014;Alberto Manguel, <i>Washington Times</i><br><br>"[A] mammoth and stimulating account of the place of print in the history of knowledge. . . . Johns has written a tremendously learned primer."&#x2014;D. Graham Burnett, <i>New Republic</i><br><br>"A detailed, engrossing, and genuinely eye-opening account of the formative stages of the print culture. . . . This is scholarship at its best."&#x2014;Merle Rubin, <i>Christian Science Monitor</i><br><br>"The most lucid and persuasive account of the new kind of knowledge produced by print. . . . A work to rank alongside McLuhan."&#x2014;John Sutherland, <i>The Independent</i><br><br>"Entertainingly written. . . . The most comprehensive account available . . . well documented and engaging."&#x2014;Ian Maclean, <i>Times Literary Supplement</i></p><p>Weighing in at 750-plus pages, Adrian Johns's sturdy tome is several books in one. At one level, it is a close study of print culture in early modern England, a time of civil war in which social and civic relations were being remade from the mores of feudal monarchy to a politics approximating modern democracy. In this transformation, the printing press was an essential vehicle for empowering the common people, and control over the publishing industry was contested among several parties--the government, authors, booksellers, the printers themselves. At another level, Johns's book is a study of the role of printing in the formation of scientific knowledge, a means whereby scientific discoveries could be widely circulated and codified. At another, it is a contribution to the sociology of communication, concentrating on changes in English society thanks to the press, through which a literate but remarkably isolated people who, an 18th-century writer observed, knew no more of the city and countryside outside their immediate neighborhood than they did of France or Russia, could become aware of the larger world--often over the objections of power-makers like Sir Francis Bacon, who urged that the people not be given access to information that did not immediately concern them. <p> Johns's book is dense with facts and quotations from the contemporary literature, but his prose is lightened by keen observation and telling anecdotes. (In one, Benjamin Franklin tried to make his way across Europe as a journeyman printer but grew so disgusted at the copious drinking of his fellow tradesmen that he switched careers, an accident that would change the course of history.) <i>The Nature of the Book</i> will be especially useful to those now tracking the communications revolution of the late 20th century, in which new technologies are once again changing power relations and supplanting old media. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>By and large, our trust in the veracity of books goes unquestioned, a tacit assumption made possible by virtue of the concerted efforts of writers and printers at the dawn of print culture. Believing that attaining an understanding of this crucial legacy, and the complex nexus of knowledge and print, is key to appreciating many of the subtleties of modern civilization, Johns tracks the evolution of the book by focusing on the book trade as practiced in one hugely influential locale, London. In his exacting and often pioneering narrative, Johns chronicles the complexity of the craft, politics, and economies of printing and book publishing, with profiles of seminal individuals, discussion of the physiology of reading, and penetrating scrutiny of the rather shaky foundations of scientific, philosophical, and historical discourse. There has been a noticeable surge in new research into the history of reading, a line of inquiry inspired, no doubt, by the spread of electronic technology, a communications frontier begging for exactly the sort of rigorous standards that were applied to print four centuries ago. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>The Grandmother&#39;s Bible</h2><p>For many women, being a grandmother is God&#x2019;s finest gift---they have achieved great depth of experience and breadth of love, and they have grandchildren with whom to share these qualities. The Grandmother&#x2019;s Bible is the first Bible published for this active, engaged, Bible-reading audience.

The development is organized around a progressively more sophisticated analysis of particular natural systems and weaves examples throughout the presentation. Explorations of phenomena such as transitions to chaos, nonlinear resonances, and resonance overlaps to help the student to develop appropriate analytic tools for understanding. Computational algorithms communicate methods used in the analysis of dynamical phenomena. Expressing the methods of mechanics in a computer language forces them to be unambiguous and computationally effective. Once formalized as a procedure, a mathematical idea also becomes a tool that can be used directly to compute results.</p><p>The student actively explores the motion of systems through computer simulation and experiment. This active exploration is extended to the mathematics. The requirement that the computer be able to interpret any expression provides strict and immediate feedback as to whether an expression is correctly formulated. The interaction with the computer uncovers and corrects many deficiencies in understanding.</p></p><p>Gerald Jay Sussman is Panasonic Professor of Electrical Engineering at MIT.<p>Sussman and Wisdom have reinvented classical mechanics for the computer age, freeing their students from the unrealistic integrable systems that dominate the traditional course and leading them to realistic kinds of systems that can now be studied on modern computers. They do this with a passion for clarity and conceptual rigor that leads to new general insights as well. Soon we will all understand the Legendre transformation in their new and elegant way.</p> (David Ritz Finkelstein, School of Physics, Georgia Institute of Technology)<br><br><p>"By making the physics precise enough to run on a computer, the authors open the door to a deeper understanding of classical reality, with the promise of a deeper understanding of all reality."--Piet Hut, Professor of Astrophysics, Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, New Jersey</p><br><br><p>"How can one write a new book on classical mechanics? Hasn't everything already been said? No! Things have changed. Now that there are computers, you can actually solve the equations of motion for interesting problems. Mathematical niceties are not the obsession of the authors, but rather to find out what happens, by a natural combination of mathematical argument and computer use. This new and effective approach should attract students to a subject which, since Newton, has constantly managed to rejuvenate itself."--David Ruelle, Honorary Professor, Institut des Hautes Etudes Scientifique, France</p></p><h2>Juvenile Delinquency in a Diverse Society</h2><p>This engaging, student-friendly text takes a critical look at juvenile delinquency today. Authors Kristin Bates and Richelle Swan examine the phenomenon of juvenile delinquency in the context of real communities and social policies, integrating into the text the many social factors that shape juvenile delinquency and its control (including race, ethnicity, class, gender, and sexuality). Offering a thorough mix of traditional and cutting-edge theories, research, and practices, this text helps students develop critical thinking skills and answer many of the difficult questions on juvenile delinquency that they will face in their careers and lives.</p><p><p><b>Kristin A.

This is the book that we&#x2032;ve all been waiting for. <em>Gender and Nation</em> spells out in clear and accessible prose the main ideas of a complex and vitally important area of feminist scholarship. For far too long, issues of nationhood, citizenship and the military have been viewed as male provinces. Turning this literature on its head, Yuval-Davis demonstrates that issues of gender remain central to nationalist struggles on both sides of state power. Especially refreshing is [the book&#x2032;s] ability to visualize a politics that takes these contested power relations into account.... a must read." Author: Patricia Hill Collins Published On: 2014-06-10<br><br>"Nira Yuval-Davis carries feminist strategy a bold step forward, avoiding essentialism, skirting relativism to develop a theory of &#x2032;transversal&#x2032; alliances between women founded not on diverse identities but on shared values. In the process, she rewrites the theory of nationalism. A much-needed book." Author: Cynthia Cockburn Published On: 2014-06-10<br><br>"The question of gender has been systematically neglected in traditional political science. In <em>Gender and Nation</em> Nira Yuval-Davis shows how women reproduce nations biologically, culturally and symbolically. In criticizing the assumptions of the public/private split, her own argument is intensely personal and political. An extraordinarily powerful and comprehensive feminist account of the nation-state, it presents a far-reaching critique of the gender-blindness of political theory.<em> <strong>Gender and Nation</strong></em> is a major contribution to the expanding field of citizenship studies.

Author: Sociological Research Online Published On: 2014-06-10<br><br>"Yuval-Davis&#x2032;s main argument is that neither &#x2032;nation&#x2032; nor &#x2032;gender&#x2032; can be understood separately. She posits several ways in which women are targeted as ethnic subjects.... a necessary read." Author: Feminist Magazine Published On: 2014-06-10<br><br>"Through this very thorough form of presentation, Yuval-Davis not only convinces the reader that the gender and nation inter-relationship is a crucial one, reinforcing the mutual constructions of each other, but she also manages to highlight the complexity of their shared bond. The book will be of great value to those working in the field of international relations theories as well as to all readers with an interest in gender studies." <strong><em></em></strong> Author: Journal of Peace Research Published On: 2014-06-10<br><br>"Yuval-Davis addresses both theory and practice starting out with a discussion of theorising about gender, women, ethnicity and nation, moving on to a more sustained analysis of how these discourses have impacted upon women. The analysis then widens as she looks at cultural reproduction and gender, citizenship, the military and war before ending up with a final discussion on women, ethnicity and empowerment.... This is an interesting, readable and thoughtful book and should be read by everyone interested in nations and ethnicities." Author: Ethnic Conflict Research Digest Published On: 2014-06-10<br><br>"Cleary written with lively examples, <em>Gender and Nation</em> tackles nationalism in a way that is sensitive to gender, ethnicity and other forms of diversity.

The project encourages a new way of looking at visual objects from the territories that are conventionally labeled "medicine" and "art."<br><br>The human body is an astounding feat of engineering. For centuries man has striven to understand its complexities, both artistically and anatomically, often resorting to human dissection. Illustrating the point at which medicine and art collide, <i>Know Thyself</i> brings together an extraordinary range of more than 250 objects from more than eighty medical and art museums and collections worldwide. Works of art from across the centuries include the anatomical drawings of Leonardo, Michelangelo, Dï¿½rer, and Stubbs, seventeenth-century portraits of surgeons and paintings by great masters including Rembrandt, Hogarth, Courbet, Gericault, and Degas.

This is the first time in the history of the United States that the quality of the education provided for our citizens has been recognized politically as being strategically important to national success and survival. Educational issues are among the major concerns of voters; therefore, not surprisingly, they are debated vigorously by candidates for public office at all levels of government and they are covered regularly on the front pages of major newspapers. </p> <p> Today's educational leaders need to possess a broad variety of skills that enable them to function comfortably and effectively in changing environments and under highly politicized conditions. In these new circumstances, change is the only constant. The mission of this book is to foster understanding of this reality among those preparing for careers in leading educational institutions and to help develop skills necessary for working competently within them. For better or for worse, this is a dynamic and exciting period in human history. Because of the fluidity of the situation, it is a period of unparalleled opportunity and of potential danger. To capitalize on the opportunities and to minimize the dangers demands extraordinarily wise leadership in all sectors and in all enterprises, including education. </p> <p> While pervasive social change affects persons in all walks of life, there is bound to be greater impact upon those in positions of great social visibility and concernï¿½such as persons holding administrative and supervisory responsibility for educational systems. Society has a right to expect adept performance from people in those positions. Under these conditions, proficient leadership cannot be a matter of copying conventional behavior. To advance education, there is a clear need for educational leaders to have and exercise: the ability to comprehend the dynamics of human affairs as a basis for relevant action under novel conditions; a better understanding of issues and processes in educational institutions; and greater originality and collaboration in designing strategic policies. Their approach to the opportunities and problems confronting them must remain hypothetical and open-ended so that more may be learned by what is done. </p> <p> Graham (1999) saw the accomplishments of the new public schools during the first quarter of the twentieth century concentrating on assimilating the flood of immigrants pouring into the country. The middle years focused on broadening the curriculum, especially at the secondary level, to include vocational subjects and courses in social and personal adjustment that enabled secondary schools to address the educational needs of most of the student population. The 1960s and 1970s addressed issues of equity and access among genders and ethnic groups. <i>During the first three-quarters of the century, Graham concluded, the schools were much more successful in enrolling students than in teaching them</i> (emphasis added). This practice is no longer acceptable. Schools must now set out to correct the situation by focusing on raising the achievement levels of <i>all</i> students. </p> <p> Past assumptions used by educators in designing schools and school curricula no longer hold across the board. Children are less likely to come from majority backgrounds, they are more likely to be members of nontraditional families, and they are more likely to be poor. Education through high school and beyond is essential if graduates are to be employed in other than menial jobs and to enjoy comfortable standards of living. Well-paying employment opportunities increasingly require sophisticated intellectual skills. Educational leadership is being challenged to design new curricula that recognize the multicultural nature of students, provide institutional support for those at risk, and link schooling to employment and citizenship. Solving our "educational" crisis will require coordination of schools' efforts with those of other social agencies in the community. </p> <p> Not only will school leaders of the future be working with a student body markedly different from that of the past, the organizational structures and professional and political relationships will also be quite different. These changes will produce a new climate for school organizations that demands a transformational rather than hierarchical leadership. Parents and community members are likely to have greater influence on the organization and operation of schools through membership on school councils or through parental choice of schooling. The relationships between teachers and administrators are likely to be collegial, not authoritarian. Principals and teachers are likely to have greater professional discretion as many decisions formerly made at the district, state, and federal levels are left to schools. Nevertheless, local, state, and federal authorities will continue to set certain parameters. We can expect states, in particular, to set achievement standards, to design curricula to meet those standards, and to administer examinations to identify schools failing to meet those standards. </p> <p> For several years, the authors co-taught an introductory course for students of educational administration. We sought in vain to find an appropriate text that would be comprehensive in coverage, yet have sufficient depth to lead students to a fundamental understanding of relevant issues. We wanted a text that was eclectic, not ideological, in approach, and that would emphasize an "action-research" perspective, compelling readers to consider critically the theoretical underpinnings of current educational practice and motivating them to seek practical alternative approaches. Not finding such a text, we set out to create our own: <i>Fundamental Concepts of Educational Leadership</i> is the result. </p> <p> The careful reader will quickly detect that we do not subscribe entirely to any particular philosophy of education. We attempt to report the best of what has been produced by researchers regardless of their paradigm and orientation. We view the study of leadership as a multiple-perspective activity. Theories of leadership should not be viewed as competing with one another in the quest for the "one best view" (Sergiovanni, 1984). Each approach, each theory, has inherent strengths and weaknesses. Each theory is better able to illuminate and explain <i>certain</i> aspects of each concept. Taken together, a more complete understanding of the concept is possible through the power of triangulation and perspective. </p> <p><b>New to This Edition</b></p> <p> The second edition continues to set forth principles undergirding the knowledge base of educational leadership, updated to address new and evolving thinking, learning, and organizational paradigms that are in a significant period of transformation. The book is still highly applicable to introductory courses in programs that prepare educational administrators, but is also recommended as a basic guide for all educational practitioners. As with the first edition, leadership principles are presented within a systems framework. The second edition maintains the thorough coverage of relevant theory of the first, but is more consistent in relating that theory to practice. </p> <p> In the previous edition, we defined <i>leadership</i> as influencing the actions of others in achieving desirable ends. While that definition is historically based on a significant and important body of knowledge, new definitions reflect a major rethinking of the concept. Today, <i>leadership</i> is also thought of as an overall action/change orientationï¿½a transformation occurring in and across numerous educational environments. Leadership in this new arena of transformation becomes less role-specific in the traditional sense, while it amasses broad new elements that expand its overall character. </p> <p> Today a leader (in whatever situation that might involve) can be thought of as a teacher, steward, facilitator, pathfinder, aligner, empowerer, appraiser, forecaster, enabler, and/or advisor. As this incomplete list expands to engulf a multitude of possibilities, you begin to sense the critical themes that further define leadership for the educational practitioner today. Under evolving conditions, leadership takes on an action-rich perspective. Leadership becomes the capacity to generate, operationalize, and evaluate a continuously changing environmentï¿½to build feedback into environments in the process of continuous improvement. </p> <p> With these new considerations becoming more apparent, we have reorganized the divisions of the book as our examination of the various aspects of leadership unfolds. Part One, whose title remains "Leadership in a Period of Dynamic Change," presents the current and projected contexts of educational leadership and discusses systems theory and leadership theory, which continue to serve as the undergirding concepts of the book. Parts Two, Three, Five, and Six carry new titles reflecting added content and different organization and emphases: "Schools as Learning Organizations: Communication and Human Interaction," "The Generation and Use of Information in a Learning Organization," "Strategy Formulation and Implementation," and "Leadership for a New Millennium." </p> <p> In Chapter 7, addressing processes of inquiry and analysis, more attention is given to naturalistic and action research orientations, supplementing the already strong discussion of quantitative approaches that appeared in the first edition. Theory development is de-emphasized relative to the first edition, while greater application is developed to provide a stronger connection to ongoing organizational functioning. </p> <p> Chapter 8, focusing on evaluation, is an updated version of the original chapter with a significant new section giving the essence of the quality movement and its relation to program evaluation, student achievement, and staff evaluation. Another addition is a section of commentary about national and state...</p></p><h2>Elementary Differential Equations</h2><p>Teaching students to first solve those differential equations that have the most frequent and interesting applications, this book introduces the principle ideas of each topic.

Read on... and bust loose! </p> <p> <b>Top Six Myths About Being Successful in Business </b><br> Amazon-exclusive content from author Robert Scheinfeld </p><table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p></p> <b>Myth 1: You must work hard and long to succeed.</b><br> This myth is created and enhanced by things we&#x2019;re taught directly and indirectly as we grow up. The flames of it are then fanned strongly by bosses, fellow employees, partners, stockholders, and customers obsessed with results being produced -- no matter the cost. In business, there's always too much to do and not enough time to do it, so most businesspeople get trapped on the "hamster wheel," of working long and hard -- usually thinking it'll be temporary, but it never is. While many <i>believe</i> it's necessary and there would be consequences if it isn't done, it's a myth that hard work and long hours are <i>required</i> in order to succeed in business. There is an alternative. <p></p> <b>Myth 2: You must be willing to do a lot of things you don't like to succeed.</b><br> For most business people, especially small-business entrepreneurs, another "that's just the way it is" myth is that you <i>must</i> be willing to wear multiple "hats" and do things you dislike in order to succeed. There are so many moving parts in a business, so many tasks that must get done in order for the business to succeed, and there never seems to be enough people or resources to get it all done. In an environment and under conditions like that, it seems to employees and business owners that they can't afford the luxury of thinking about whether they enjoy what they're doing or not, or that it even matters if they do or don't. The job must get done! But the job can get done, generally even better, if everyone loves what they're doing, and that dynamic <i>can</i> be put into place -- for you and all your team members. <p></p> <b>Myth 3: You're at the mercy of forces beyond your control that can block or limit your success.</b><br> In the world of business, we're taught, directly and indirectly, that forces beyond our control can shape and determine our success and the kinds of results we produce -- forces like the economy; the stock market; other people (employees, partners, customers, stockholders, etc.); competitors; emerging technologies; the tax service, etc. It seems perfectly reasonable to believe that forces outside of you can limit, block or restrict you, but once again, the truth is that it's just another myth. It is possible to create, grow and maintain a successful business while being completely unaffected by the outside forces we all seem so vulnerable to. <p></p> <b>Myth 4: You must constantly focus on and optimize "The 5 Power Centers of Business" to succeed.</b><br> There are 5 primary "Power Centers" in business -- Sales, Marketing, Management, Leadership and Finance -- with each Center having numerous subsets. The "how to succeed in business" party line says you must constantly focus on the 5 Power Centers, continually find ways to optimize them, go out there and do something to "make it happen" within each of the five Power Centers, or you'll fail. In a rapidly changing world where none of the Power Centers stay optimized for long, that focus and goal becomes a source of constant stress and frustration. Once again, there is an alternative way to play "The Business Game" that enables you to produce extraordinary results while simultaneously draining all the stress and frustration out of your interactions with the 5 Power Centers. <p></p> <b>Myth 5: Your supply of money is limited and therefore, income and expenses must be managed carefully -- or else!</b><br> Like Myth #3, this one is a biggie and one that's very tough for most business people to accept (until they experience the alternative themselves). In business, you're taught you have a limited supply of money available to you. You're taught that when you spend money (expenses), you have less money available to you, you'll run out and fail if you don't manage your limits (the numbers) very carefully. Makes sense, right? Seems perfectly reasonable and like an accurate description of what happens in business, right? Wrong. This myth is one of the most insidious and damaging myths in the entire world of business. It is possible to create, grow and maintain a successful business while having a radically different relationship to "the numbers" -- and without the financial limits, restrictions, ups and downs common to so many business scenarios. <p></p> <b>Myth 6: You must have goals, plans and targets to succeed.</b><br> "If you don't have goals, targets and plans, how can you get where you want to go?" That's the popular battle cry in the world of business. Once again, it makes sense and appears perfectly reasonable, except it's just another myth. First, all day long, every day, business people set goals, create targets, and write plans, and fail to achieve most of them. There are two main reasons for that: <ol> <li>We live in a rapidly changing world that can quickly obsolete even the best laid plans. </li> <li>In alignment with Myth #3 above, there are so many forces beyond our control that we can't efficiently anticipate or plan for in advance. More important than that, however, there is another way to play The Business Game where you have no goals, targets, or plans and yet you still succeed and produce extraordinary results-- often beyond your wildest dreams. </li> </ol> <b>Popping The Myths...</b><br> As you can see, at the core of each of the 6 Myths I just mentioned, is what I call "power outside dynamics." To succeed in business, we learn to look outside ourselves and do our best to manage, control, and manipulate the people and forces "out there" that can have so much impact on us. But that's a battle that never ends, a battle we never win, for the two reasons I shared in Myth #6 above. Fighting that battle and trying to win it will always be a source of stress, frustration and ultimately, failure (of one kind or another). <p></p> The solution isn't to find a way to build a better team, have a better product or service, or enhance your sales, marketing, management, leadership or finance strategies and techniques. The real solution is to do a complete one-eighty, shift your focus away from what's outside of you, and put your focus onto what's <i>inside</i> of you -- in a very unique way. <p></p> As tough as it may be for you to accept at this point, it's possible to move into a new "inner place" -- an expanded state of "Consciousness" if you will -- from which you can play what I call "The New Business Game," a radically different way of experiencing the world of business. <p></p> When you play The New Business Game, outside forces no longer have any limiting impact on you. In fact, they all align to support you in doing what you love and producing extraordinary results -- with plenty of free time and the lifestyle of your choosing. When you play The New Business Game, the optimization of The 5 Power Centers -- and your supply of money -- take care of themselves, without you needing to manage, struggle with, or worry about it. <p></p> Does this sound like the ramblings of a crazy man? Like nonsense, pie in the sky dreaming, or "woo-woo"? Maybe it <i>sounds</i> like that to you. Maybe it doesn't. But it's <i>true</i> no matter how you perceive it right now. Most importantly, I can show you how to prove it to yourself -- every last word, idea and concept I've shared with you here. <p></p> For more tips, and to discover how to actually move into that inner place, actually move into that expanded state of Consciousness, and to start playing The New Business Game, read my book, <i>Busting Loose From The Business Game</i>. <p></p> "...this book will open your eyes to many new possibilities.

Some charged that students were not learning enough, while others complained that the schools were not furthering social progress. In <i>Left Back,</i> education historian Diane Ravitch describes this ongoing battle of ideas and explains why school reform has so often disappointed. She recounts grandiose efforts to use the schools for social engineering, even while those efforts diminished the schools' ability to provide a high-quality education for all children. By illuminating the history of education in the twentieth century, <i>Left Back</i> points the way to reviving American schools today.</p><p><b>Diane Ravitch</b> is one of the nation's foremost historians of education and a leading education policy analyst. Her landmark books deeply influenced the national discussion of education standards in the 1980s and 1990s. She has been a professor at Teachers College, Columbia University, and at New York University. She served in the U.S. Department of Education as assistant secretary in charge of education research. She currently holds the Brown Chair in Education Studies at the Brookings Institution, edits <i>Brookings Papers on Education Policy,</i> and is a member of the National Assessment Governing Board. She lives in Brooklyn, New York.<b>Chapter One: The Educational Ladder</b><br><br>In the closing years of the nineteenth century, Americans prided themselves on their free public schools. Most children attended the public schools, and Americans felt a patriotic attachment to them. Unlike Europe, which was burdened with rigid class barriers, in America it was believed that the public school could enable any youngster to rise above the most humble origins and make good on the nation's promise of equal opportunity for all. Oscar D. Robinson, the principal of the high school in Albany, New York, declared that "the famous simile of the educational ladder, with its foot in the gutter and its top in the university, is in this favored country no poetic fancy, but portrays in vivid language a fact many times verified in the knowledge of every intelligent adult."<br><br>The schools were expected to make social equality a reality by giving students an equal chance to develop their mental powers to the fullest. William A. Mowry, the school superintendent in Providence, Rhode Island, believed that the schools would abolish caste in America: "Your bootblack to-day may be your lawyer to-morrow, and the rail-splitter or the tanner or the humble schoolmaster at twenty years of age may become the chief magistrate of fifty millions of free people before he is fifty." What was most important was not learning a trade but learning intelligence and virtue. As people became more intelligent and broad-minded, he believed, the community would improve. He declared, "Let the doors of the school-house, the 'brain factory,' be open to all the children; and the child once started on the career of learning, let him not find those doors ever closed against him."<br><br>This was the American dream, the promise of the public school to open wide the doors of opportunity to all who were willing to learn and study. The schools would work their democratic magic by disseminating knowledge to all who sought it.<br><br>Americans were especially proud of their common schools, the schools that included grades one through eight. By 1890, 95 percent of children between the ages of five and thirteen were enrolled in school for at least a few months of the year. Less than 5 percent of adolescents went to high school, and even fewer entered college. Beyond the age of thirteen, there were large gaps in opportunities to attend school. Race, poverty, and location certainly narrowed access to schooling. Neither a high school diploma nor a college degree, however, was required to get a good job or to succeed in business. The growing economy had plenty of jobs, especially for those who had gained the literacy that was supplied by the common schools; only those who planned to enter the learned professions (law, medicine, the ministry) found it necessary to go to college.<br><br>At century's end, there was no American educational "system." There were thousands of district schools, hundreds of colleges and universities, and scores of normal schools that trained teachers. The federal bureau of education, headed by a U.S. commissioner of education, had no control over local schools; its sole function was to collect information about the condition and progress of education. Education was very much a local matter, controlled by lay school boards made up of businessmen, civic leaders, and parents. State education agencies were weak, small, and insignificant; each state had a department of education, but its few employees had little or no power over local school districts. Even big-city school districts had few supervisors. The public schools of Baltimore, for example, had 1,200 teachers in 1890 but only two superintendents for the entire school district.<br><br>Despite local control, the American public school was remarkably similar across regions. Everywhere the goals were few and simple: Children learned not only the basics of reading, 'riting, and 'rithmetic, but also the basics of good behavior. Principals and teachers considered character and intelligence to be of equal value, and neither was possible without "disciplining the will," which required prompt, unquestioning obedience to the teacher and the school rules.<br><br>The common schools emphasized reading, writing, speaking, spelling, penmanship, grammar, arithmetic, patriotism, a clear moral code, and strict discipline, enforced when necessary by corporal punishment. The values they sought to instill were honesty, industry, patriot-ism, responsibility, respect for adults, and courtesy. The schools were vital community institutions, reflecting the mores of parents and churches; events at the local school, such as spelling bees, musical exhibitions, and speaking contests, were often important community events.<br><br>When the muckraker Dr. Joseph Mayer Rice visited public schools in thirty-six cities in 1892, he complained bitterly about the quality of education that he saw. In New York City, the school he visited was "the most dehumanizing institution that I have ever laid eyes upon, each child being treated as if he possessed a memory and the faculty of speech, but no individuality, no sensibilities, no soul." Recitation by classes "in concert" was common. In Baltimore, the children added long columns of numbers, singing "in perfect rhythm," "one and one are two; two and one are three; three and one are four," and so on. In Boston, the children sang together, "N-a-m-e, n-a-m-e, name; e at the end of the word makes the a say its own name, e at the end of the word makes the a say its own name; h-e-r-e, here; h-e-r-e; e at the end of the word makes the e say its own name, e at the end of the word makes the e say its own name." In Cincinnati, children were singing and spelling words. In Saint Louis, teachers cut students off with remarks such as "Speak when you are spoken to" and "Don't talk, listen," and continually reminded students, "Don't lean against the wall" and "Keep your toes on the line."<br><br>Teachers seldom had much pedagogical training, so they relied mainly on time-tested methods of recitation from textbooks. Regardless of locale, textbooks were similar, as competitive publishing houses copied one another's best-selling books. The publishers hoped for a national market for their textbooks and knew that their products would be judged by members of local school boards, for whom continuity and tradition counted more than innovation. The school reading books were usually published as a series of four to six graduated texts; the first one or two taught reading, and the rest were compilations of good literature, usually selected to illustrate ethical and moral precepts.<br><br>The stories, poems, speeches, allusions, aphorisms, and fables in the readers introduced American children to a common literary tradition. The celebrated McGuffey Readers contained excerpts from writers such as Shakespeare, Hawthorne, and Dickens. First published in 1836, the McGuffey series dominated the textbook market in the latter half of the nineteenth century, eventually selling more than 120 million books. They were handed down from student to student and read out loud over the family dining table. When Theodore Roosevelt lambasted critics as "Meddlesome Matties," a generation of Americans recognized the allusion to a familiar story in McGuffey's. Other popular textbooks contained many of the same poems and speeches, making cultural touchstones of such pieces as Robert Southey's "The Battle of Blenheim," Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's "The Village Blacksmith" and "Paul Revere's Ride," John Greenleaf Whittier's "The Barefoot Boy," and Marc Antony's oration in Shakespeare's <i> Julius Caesar.</i><br><br>The reading textbooks of the common schools emphasized the importance of proper elocution and public speaking; they encouraged students to read out loud. Public speaking was considered excellent preparation for the duties of life in a democratic society, such as participating in local politics and community lyceums. In daily lessons, boys and girls learned to pronounce words and syllables with accuracy and care. Tongue-twisting exercises taught elocution:<br><br>The sun shines on the shop signs.<br><br>She sells sea shells. Shall he sell sea shells?<br><br>Six gray geese and eight gray ganders.<br><br>Round the rough and rugged rocks the ragged rascal ran.<br><br>The old cold scold sold a school coal-scuttle.<br><br>Then there was the classic tale of Peter Piper, which amply exercised the lips and tongue:<br><br>Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers;<br><br>Did Peter Piper pick a peck of pickled peppers?<br><br>If Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers,<br><br>Where's the peck of pickled peppers Peter Piper picked?<br><br>The school readers and history textbooks favored patriotic selections. Children recited the stirring words of Patrick Henry, George Washington, Daniel Webster, Abraham Lincoln, and other noted Americans. Rote memorization was common, especially in learning history and geography. This method had mixed results. With the rote method, children amassed a solid store of facts that they could use to understand more complex material, but they also might memorize words, phrases, even lengthy passages without understanding their meaning.<br><br>The history books taught facts and patriotism. In the textbooks, the greatest national events were the Revolutionary War and the Civil War. Children studied the justice of the American cause in the former and the perfidy of the Southern states in the latter (unless they attended school in the South, where textbooks portrayed the Southern cause sympathetically). The textbooks described American history as a stirring story that demonstrated the importance of liberty, independence, and resistance to tyranny.<br><br>Literary readers echoed the same themes of courage and patriotism. Students often memorized and recited pieces such as Whittier's "Barbara Frietchie," "The Debate Between Hayne and Webster," Alfred, Lord Tennyson's "The Charge of the Light Brigade," and Lincoln's Gettysburg Address.<br><br>Geography lessons taught pride of country and often racial pride (and racism) as well; racial stereotyping was commonplace in the geography books. The facts of geography were of great importance, including such matters as the height of important mountains and the names of continents, oceans, and rivers. Geography was often taught by chants and rhymes, which was referred to as "singing geography." One popular chant consisted of the name of the state, the name of its capital city, and the name of the river where it was located. One popular chant began<br><br>Maine, Augusta, on the Kennebec,<br><br>New Hampshire, Concord, on the Merrimac,<br><br>and went on to include each of the states. The schoolhouse would often ring with geography chants. Some teachers used music to teach the alphabet and the multiplication tables as well, with students marching up and down the aisles of the classroom singing (to the tune of "Yankee Doodle Dandy"), "Five times five is twenty-five and five times six is thirty..."<br>ard<br><br>In mathematics, teachers "drilled" students in "mental arithmetic," requiring them to solve mathematical problems "in their head," without a pen or pencil. Children were expected to stand in front of the class and answer such problems as:<br><br>How many square inches in a piece of paper six inches long and four inches wide?<br><br>Reduce to their lowest terms: 12?16, 24?36, 16?28, 28?49, 32?36.<br><br>Henry paid 1?4 of all his money for a knife, 1?8 for a ball, and 1?8 for a necktie: what part of his money had he left?<br><br>A harness was sold for 3?4 of 4?5 of what it cost. What was the loss per cent?<br><br>Educators thought of these exercises as a valuable form of mental gymnastics. For many children, though, they were surely mental drudgery.<br><br>The common school was dedicated to correct spelling, and spelling lessons were conducted every day. Competition was keen, and sometimes public exhibitions were held for parents and the community. Some teachers divided their class into teams, which competed with each other. Or a teacher would line up the entire class and give spelling words to the child at the head of the line; when that child missed a word, the next in line would "go to the head of the class." Schools competed with each other, and sometimes entire communities would participate in the spelling bee, showing off the prowess of the best spellers.<br><br>The aim of the common school was clear: to promote sufficient learning and self-discipline so that people in a democratic society could be good citizens, read the newspapers, get a job, make their way in an individualistic and competitive society, and contribute to their community's well-being.<br><br><b>The Missing Rung of the Ladder</b><br><br>At the end of the nineteenth century, almost every community had an elementary school, but public high schools were sparse. By 1900, there were nearly one thousand colleges and universities (of widely varying quality, some no more advanced than high schools) scattered across the country. In between was a melange of public high schools, private academies, and preparatory departments of colleges. There could not be an educational ladder from "the gutter to the university" unless public high schools were as readily available as common schools.<br><br>Until the middle of the nineteenth century, most secondary education was supplied by thousands of small private academies. Most offered not only the classical curriculum of Latin, Greek, and mathematics, but also modern subjects such as history, science, and English, and practical subjects such as bookkeeping, surveying, and navigation.<br><br>As the economy changed from agrarian to industrial and commercial, and young people began to need more education, many cities -- including New York, Chicago, New Orleans, Detroit, Saint Louis, San Francisco, and Dubuque -- opened public high schools. These new schools existed in "every variety and quality" and usually offered both classical and modern studies. Reluctant taxpayers grumbled and occasionally sued to block public funding for public secondary schools, and critics complained that they were elitist and unnecessary. Nonetheless, enrollments in the new public high schools soon eclipsed those in the private academies.<br><br>Most towns viewed their new public high school as a source of community pride. In Nineveh, Indiana, the township high school was credited with raising "the standard of intelligence, of morality, of taste, and therefore, of life among the people. While a few in the township are opposed to higher education, the vast majority favor the school and would not do without it." Of the high school's twenty-two pupils, half commuted from outlying farms. The curriculum consisted of Latin (including two books of Caesar and three of Virgil), mathematics, English literature, history, geology, physics, rhetoric, geography, and civil government. This was not an atypical high school. Every high school worthy of its name offered Latin and mathematics, the mainstays of the classical curriculum.<br><br>The people of Nineveh, Indiana, may have been happy with their high school, but the leaders of American education regularly debated what high schools should teach and to whom. As secondary enrollments steadily grew, ardent advocates of different persuasions contended over the future direction of the high schools, over whether they should educate students for college or for work, what they should teach, and whether they should have a required program for all.<br><br>It was an era of wrenching social and economic change, of rapid industrialization, high immigration, and increasing urbanization. It was a period in which social reformers sought strategies to combat the ill effects of these changes, especially in the cities, where living conditions for the poor were abysmal.

The text has been thoroughly checked and altered to take account of historical and archaeological research on the subject over the last decade. As well as short sections of new text inserted throughout, the central chapter on the Arab conquest and its aftermath has been entirely rewritten and enlarged. An entirely new bibliographical essay has been added, covering the state of scholarship up to 1994. The genealogies and lists of rulers have been corrected to bring them into line with the latest views, and a new preface has been written to describe the changes in the directions of research in Spain and beyond in the period since the publication of the first edition.</p><p>In Spain the 1980s and 1990s have seen a dramatic revival of regional aspirations towards greater self-expression and increased political autonomy, following a period of rigid centralisation of government in Madrid and the attempted imposition of cultural uniformity. This tension between the ethnic and cultural diversity of the different regions of the Iberian peninsula and the attempts of various rulers to impose political and &#39;national&#39; unity goes back to at least the time of the Roman Empire. In the period covered in this book there occurred many of the major events that shaped the subsequent history of Spain: the unification of the peninsula under Rome, the attempted imposition of a unitary Christian culture under the Visigoths, and the shattering of both of these by Arab conquest in 711. At the same time the Basque and Catalan national identities began to take shape, and the resistance to the Arab conquest by the Asturians, Galicians, Leonese and Castillians formed these and other distinctive components of the Hispanic cultural mix. In this fully corrected, revised and partly rewritten version of this authoritative study, first published in 1983, account has been taken of the substantial new research undertaken on all relevant periods of Spanish history since the first edition. In particular, the discussion of the Arab conquest and its impact has been entirely reconsidered. The bibliography and notes have been fully updated. Some challenging new interpretations are also presented here for the first time. This volume forms a companion to Angus MacKay&#39;s Spain in the Middle Ages: From Frontier to Empire, 1000-1500, from the same publishers, and contains maps, genealogical tables, alist of rulers, full references and bibliographies.<b>Roger Collins</b> is at the Department of History, University of Edinburgh.<br><b>Anthony Goodman</b> is at the Department of History, University of Edinburgh.<br></p><h2>Webster&#39;s Compact Rhyming Dictionary</h2><p>Fresh, creative expressions for the songwriter or poet to carry anywhere. 50,000 words arranged alphabetically by rhyming sounds.

The authors shed light on the complex interplay of individual, family, community, and societal forces that lead some adolescents to hurt others or themselves. Effective ways to address each of these factors in clinical and school settings are discussed and illustrated with evocative case material. The book provides essential guidance on connecting with aggressive teens and their parents and managing difficult situations that are likely to arise. The strengths-based interventions presented are applicable to a broad range of high-risk behaviors, from bullying and assault to substance abuse, self-mutilation, and suicidality.</p><p>Kenneth V.

The pearls of wisdom offered here are far-reaching, and can serve as a blueprint for private practitioners, school counselors, and others working with adolescents in schools and the community."--Matthew D. Selekman, MSW, Partners for Collaborative Solutions, Evanston, Illinois<br><br>"Hardy and Laszloffy go beyond narrowly psychological explanations of youth violence to encompass the critical role played by the broader social environment. With sensitivity, compassion, and intelligence, they detail the many ways in which social toxins in an adolescent's environment poison well-being and stimulate violence.

The central tenet of this constitution&#x2015;that colonial laws and customs could not be repugnant to the laws of England but could diverge for local circumstances&#x2015;shaped the legal development of the colonial world.</p><p>Focusing on practices rather than doctrines, Bilder describes how the pragmatic and flexible conversation about this constitution shaped colonial law: the development of the legal profession; the place of English law in the colonies; the existence of equity courts and legislative equitable relief; property rights for women and inheritance laws; commercial law and currency reform; and laws governing religious establishment. Using as a case study the corporate colony of Rhode Island, which had the largest number of appeals of any mainland colony to the English Privy Council, she reconstructs a largely unknown world of pre-Constitutional legal culture.</p></p><p>Mary Sarah Bilder is Professor of Law and Michael and Helen Lee Distinguished Scholar, Boston College Law School.<i>The Transatlantic Constitution</i> makes a major impact on the way we see the legacy of the colonial period and the later federal relationship that continues to affect us today. Mary Sarah Bilder presents an intensive examination of the structure and functioning of the legal relationship across the Atlantic, between the people of a colony and the legal metropolis in London. This exhaustively researched and deeply informed book recasts the way we think about how the "transatlantic relationship" affected law and authority. (David Konig, Washington University in St. Louis)<br><br>Mary Sarah Bilder has taken an old and long-unfashionable topic and successfully given it new interest, perspective, and importance. She is the first historian to explore the relationship between colonial legal culture and sources of constitutional authority within the British empire, and she does so with a fine appreciation for the negotiated, pragmatic, and changing nature of the relationship. This book is a major contribution to colonial American legal, constitutional, and imperial history and sets the standard for future study of the transatlantic constitution. (Bruce H. Mann, author of <i>Republic of Debtors: Bankruptcy in the Age of American Independence</i>)<br><br>Bilder describes an emerging Colonial legal profession and clearly explains the function of the local and imperial legal systems. Largely a legal history of case law that determined if Colonial divergence was indeed not repugnant, the book is rich in social history as well, with the evolving status of women and institutional religion providing much of the legal grist. (E. R. Crowther <i>Choice</i> 2005-09-01)<br><br>Mary Sarah Bilder's <i>The Transatlantic Constitution</i> is an excellent example of the wealth of fresh insights that a focus on constitutionalism still has to offer...Bilder's argument is so compelling, and her delineation of transatlantic legal culture so revealing, that historians will undoubtedly feel the need to test her results elsewhere. Atlantic history will be all the richer for it. (Alexander B. Haskell <i>William and Mary Quarterly</i> 2005-07-01)<br><br>Bilder is one of those energetically prudent scholars who appear in full control of their considerable enthusiasms. She never exaggerates her cases. She welcomes other investigations, but she rightly understands that the micro-level of investigation that we find here represents the work that is now needed in legal history, and she does not shy away from the extensions that are possible from it. There is, in fact, considerable grace in Bilder's ability to supply the details without losing her reader in them. (Robert A. Ferguson <i>Law and History Review</i> 2005-10-01)<br><br>This study of the British imperial constitution, based upon extensive research in English and American archives, is one of the more significant recent pieces of scholarship in this area...Mary Sarah Bilder has come to some new conclusions that make this short volume essential reading for all students of early America. (Herbert A. Johnson <i>Journal of American History</i> 2005-12-01)<br><br>In <i>The Transatlantic Constitution: Colonial Legal Culture and the Empire</i>, Mary Sarah Bilder finds evidence for a transatlantic constitutional culture that influenced everything from the intellectual formation of colonial lawyers and judges, to the course of appeals of inheritance cases, to the beginnings of judicial review in the early Republic...The argument is lucidly presented and clearly compelling...The clarity of Bilder's argument will make the book, and the tradition of legal constitutional history of empire from which it emanates, compelling to scholars outside the field of American legal history.

The Dixie Hummingbirds: Celebrating the Rise of Soul Gospel Music</h2><p>From the Jim Crow world of 1920s Greenville, South Carolina, to Greenwich Village's Cafï¿½ Society in the '40s, to their 1974 Grammy-winning collaboration on "Loves Me Like a Rock," the Dixie Hummingbirds have been one of gospel's most durable and inspiring groups. <br> Now, Jerry Zolten tells the Hummingbirds' fascinating story and with it the story of a changing music industry and a changing nation. When James Davis and his high-school friends starting singing together in a rural South Carolina church they could not have foreseen the road that was about to unfold before them. They began a ten-year jaunt of "wildcatting," traveling from town to town, working local radio stations, schools, and churches, struggling to make a name for themselves. By 1939 the <em>a cappella</em> singers were recording their four-part harmony spirituals on the prestigious Decca label. By 1942 they had moved north to Philadelphia and then New York where, backed by Lester Young's band, they regularly brought the house down at the city's first integrated nightclub, Cafï¿½ Society. From there the group rode a wave of popularity that would propel them to nation-wide tours, major record contracts, collaborations with Stevie Wonder and Paul Simon, and a career still vibrant today as they approach their seventy-fifth anniversary. <br> Drawing generously on interviews with Hank Ballard, Otis Williams, and other artists who worked with the Hummingbirds, as well as with members James Davis, Ira Tucker, Howard Carroll, and many others, <em>The Dixie Hummingbirds</em> brings vividly to life the growth of a gospel group and of gospel music itself.<br></p><p><br><strong>Jerry Zolten</strong> is an Assistant Professor of Communication Arts and Sciences and American Studies at Penn State University Altoona. The co-author of <em>Speaking to an Audience</em>, he has written profiles of blues artists for <em>Living Blues</em> magazine and penned the liner notes to two of The Dixie Hummingbirds latest compilation CDs. A part-time record producer and promoter, he lives in Warriors Mark, Pennsylvania.<br>The Dixie Hummingbirds, along with the Swan Silvertones and the Soul Stirrers, were the foremost popularizers of the a cappella style of gospel music that brought the spiritual music of traditional African-American communities to a wide-and primarily white-audience in the 1950s. In this excellent history, Zolten, an assistant professor of American Studies at Penn. State, Altoona, carefully and lovingly details the almost 75-year history of the Hummingbirds, from their start in the Depression to their induction into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame in 2000. He deftly explores how the group's history itself embodies numerous American ironies: that an "unintended result" of segregation "was the flowering of a distinctly African American homegrown culture" that included gospel music; that the Depression and the mass migration of African Americans from the South "created a nationwide market for black entertainers of all kinds" that allowed the Hummingbirds their initial financial success. Zolten interestingly points out that the group, known for its hard-driving vocal sound, won its only Grammy award for their own version of "Loves Me Like a Rock" by Paul Simon, whose original version had featured the Hummingbirds and brought them to a new rock-oriented audience. Adding to the book's success are Zolten's numerous interviews with founding members James Davis and Ira Tucker, as well as their many collaborators, which add personal depth to the book's amazing wealth of detail and dates. This is a fine exploration of an important style and era in the history of American popular music and culture. <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Analyst&#39;s Analyst Within</h2><p><p><em>The Analyst's Analyst Within</em> is the most illuminating study to date of how psychoanalysts' experiences with their own analysts affect their lives, their loves, and their evolving professional identities. A gifted interviewer with equally gifted interview subjects, Tessman samples different gender combinations and age ranges in showing how the values typifying different eras of psychoanalytic theorizing enter into the meaning and impact of training analyses. <br><br>Tessman's findings are striking, and they do not end with her discovery of startling differences according to the decade during which a training analysis took place. She also found that neither the theoretical orientation of the training analyst nor his or her technical preferences predicted whether, years later, the analysis would be remembered as satisfying or dissatisfying, as growth promoting or thwarting. Rather, it was the quality of affective engagement that became reliably present, with the figure of the training analyst, inscribed in all his or her particularity, accounting for the perceived sense of a truly productive analytic experience. </p> <p>Tessman's research program, which encompasses her methodology, her skill as an interviewer, and the wisdom and clarity of thought of her participants, lifts this work well beyond the perfunctory debates about psychoanalytic training that recur in the journal literature. The power of <em>The Analyst's Analyst Within</em> resides in compelling individual narratives in which analysts revisit their own treatment past - and the analyst within - with candor, vividness, and often great poignancy. The result is a book that not only supersedes previous studies of the training analysis but also opens a new vista on how and why analysis works when it works and fails when it fails.</p></p><p><p>"Tessman's task and methodology are extraordinary. She poses sophisticated study questions in order to comprehend how our analysts become memorable to us and how they fare over the years. But in the process she probes a related set of issues that involve how analysts and patients get to know each other, how they learn about each other's states of being, and how these states are affectively registered in the other. Especially impressive is her exploration of how patients get to know themselves partly through getting to know their analyst's inner states and their analyst's knowledge of their states. What is rare is the combination of a structured exploratory study of such matters with the nuanced, subtle interpretations of an obviously gifted clinician. This book should be read by anyone interested in the fate of the analyst over time, but also in the analytic process as it lives and breathes in the moment."</p> <p>- Steven H. Cooper, Ph.D., Author, <em>Objects of Hope </em>(Analytic Press, 2000)</p> <p>"Lora Tessman has provided a penetrating look at the fate of the transference after termination. In addition to offering us a microscopic view of the ex-analysand's inner world, she has also raised some provocative questions about the therapeutic action of psychoanalysis. I highly recommend this new volume to analysts and analytically oriented therapists."</p> <p>- Glen O.

Indeed, Marxist regimes have failed miserably, and with them, it seems, all reason to take the writings of Karl Marx seriously.<br> Jonathan Wolff argues that if we detach Marx the critic of current society from Marx the prophet of some never-to-be-realized worker's paradise, he remains the most impressive critic we have of liberal, capitalist, bourgeois society. The author shows how Marx's main ideas still shed light on wider concerns about culture and society and he guides the reader through Marx's notoriously difficult writings. Wolff also argues that the value of a great thinker does not depend on his or her views being true, but on other features such as originality, insight, and systematic vision. From this perspective, Marx still richly deserves to be read.<br> <em>Why Read Marx Today?</em> reinstates Marx as an important critic of current society, and not just a figure of historical interest.<br></p><p><br><strong>Jonathan Wolff</strong> is Professor of Philosophy at University College London.<br><br>"An engaging read. The author...is a particularly skillful elucidator of political philosophy. In his book, he argues that Marx was misunderstood and that the great man was right about far more than he is given credit for."--<em>The Economist</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Just So Stories</h2><p>IN the sea, once upon a time, O my Best Beloved, there was a Whale, and he ate fishes. He ate the starfish and the garfish, and the crab and the dab, and the plaice and the dace, and the skate and his mate, and the mackereel and the pickereel, and the really truly twirly-whirly eel. All the fishes he could find in all the sea he ate with his mouth-so! Till at last there was only one small fish left in all the sea, and he was a small &#39;Stute Fish, and he swam a little behind the Whale&#39;s right ear, so as to be out of harm&#39;s way. Then the Whale stood up on his tail and said, &#39;I&#39;m hungry.</p><p>How did the camel get his hump? Why won&#39;t cats do as they are told? Who invented reading and writing? How did an inquisitive little elephant change the lives of elephants everywhere? Kipling&#39;s imagined answers to such questions draw on the beast fables he heard as a child in India, as well as on folk games with language, exploring the relationships between thought, speech, and the written word. He also celebrates his own joy in fatherhood. The tales were told to his own and his friends&#39; children over many years before he wrote them down, adding poems and his own illustrations. They invite older and younger readers to share a magical experience, each contributing to the other&#39;s pleasure, but each can also enjoy them alone, as more jokes, subtexts, and exotic references emerge with every reading. This fully illustrated edition includes two extra stories and Kipling&#39;s own explanation of the title.Kipling&#39;s own drawings, with their long, funny captions, illustrate his hilarious explanations of How the Camel Got His Hump, How the Rhinoceros Got His Skin, How the Armadillo Happened, and other animal How&#39;s. He began inventing these stories in his American wife&#39;s hometown of Brattleboro, Vermont, to amuse his eldest daughter--and they have served ever since as a source of laughter for children everywhere.</p><h2>The Formation of Christendom</h2><p><p>In a lucid history of what used to be termed "the Dark Ages," Judith Herrin outlines the origins of Europe from the end of late antiquity to the coronation of Charlemagne. She shows that the clash between nascent Islam and stubburn Byzantium was the central contest that allowed "Europe" to develop, and she thereby places the rise of the West in its true Mediterranean context. Her inquiry centers on the notion of "Christendom." Instead of taking medieval beliefs for granted or separating theology from politics, she treats the faith as a material force. In a path-breaking account of the arguments over Christian doctrine, she shows how the northern sphere of the Roman world divided into two distinct and self-conscious imperial units, as the Arabs swept through the southern regions.</p><br> <p>One of the most interesting strands of the author's argument concerns religious art and iconoclasm. Her book shows how the impact of Islam's Judaic ban on graven images precipitated both the iconoclast crisis in Constantinople and the West's unique commitment to pictorial narrative, as justified by Pope Gregory the Great.</p></p><p>Judith Herrin was educated at the Universities of Cambridge and Birmingham. She currently works in the Classics Department of King&#39;s College, London.<b>Judith Herrin, Winner of the 2016 Dr A.H. Heineken Prize, Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences</b><br><br>"The main argument of Judith Herrin's <i>The Formation of Christendom</i> is that what she calls the 'initial particularity' of Europe is to be sought in the period between the fourth and the ninth centuries. . . . Herrins's scholarship is unerring, her scope is wide and her style fluent. . . . The treatment of the so-called iconoclastic controversy, the dispute over the veneration of images in Christian worship which convulsed the Byzantine world in the eighth century, is sparkling. . . . Debate about where modern Europe came from . . . will be enriched by this civilized and accomplished book."<b>--<i>The Economist</i></b><br><br>". . . Herrin follows some magnificent themes with the lucid dispassion of a good detective."<b>--Thomas D'Evelyn, <i>The Christian Science Monitor</i></b><br><br>"It is [the] binding together of distant past and immediate present which makes Judith Herrin's scholarship so exciting: she can convince the reader that the roots of Western distinctiveness really do lead all the way to forgotten episcopal meetings in small towns in Asia Minor in the fourth century."<b>--Michael Ignatieff, <i>The Observer</i></b><br><br>"...a learned, challenging, and gracefully written interpretation of the transition from antiquity to the Middle Ages."<b>--Robert L. Wilken, <i>Commonweal</i></b><br><br>"Judith Herrin has produced an ambitious, learned, lucid, and instructive book."<b>--Alexander Murray, <i>The Times Literary Supplement</i></b><br><br>"...it will no longer be possible to hop from pagan antiquity to Carolingian Europe as if nothing had happened in between. Judith Herrin has laid her sheet of paper over the map of that 'dark' age and rubbed and rubbed until the rich web of connections and cracks has shown through."<b>--Marina Warner, <i>The Independent</i></b><br><br>"This is a serious and powerful book....a grand synthesis on a scale few people would dare now to attempt, ranging across diverse societies with considerable assurance."<b>--Christopher J. Wickham, <i>The International History Review</i></b></p><h2>Encyclopedia of Homelessness, 2 Volume Set</h2><p><p>The <strong>Encyclopedia of Homelessness</strong> is the first systematic effort to organize and summarize what we know about this complex topic which impacts not only the homeless but all of society. The Encyclopedia focuses on the current situation in the United States, with a comparative sampling of homelessness around the world.&nbsp;The Encyclopedia contains entries on Australia, Brazil, Canada, Cuba, France, Guatemala, Japan, Nigeria, Russia, Sweden, the United Kingdom, Zimbabwe, Tokyo, Calcutta, London and others from around the world. The <strong>Encyclopedia of Homelessness</strong> meets the needs of a broad audience, offering a rich history and the data, views, and perspectives of experts from different disciplines and perspectives.<br></p></p><p>Although there is nothing new about homelessness, the coverage of the topic in this encyclopedia is indeed new. According to the introduction, its goal is to "summarize our knowledge of homelessness including describing the patterns of homelessness, focusing on the recent situation in America and a sampling of homelessness around the world." Most of the contributors are affiliated with either academic institutions or social service agencies, and major researchers in the field of homeless studies, including Ellen Bassuk, cofounder of the National Center on Family Homelessness; Martha Burt, director of the Social Services Program at the Urban Institute; and Gretchen Noll, deputy director of programs at the National Network for Youth, make up the editorial board.<p>The alphabetically arranged entries include articles about homelessness in eight major U.S. cities and 30 cities and nations around the world. As outlined in the "Reader's Guide" in volume 1, causes of homelessness, historical aspects, housing, policy, health and lifestyle issues, and service systems are among the broad topics covered. Examples of entry headings include <i>Abeyance theory, Child care, Gentrification, HIV and AIDS, Images of homelessness in contemporary documentary film, Low-income housing, Marginality, Panhandling, Safe havens</i>, and <i>Salvation Army</i>. Ranging in length from one to four pages, entries provide cross-references and lists of further reading. Additional resources are offered in the several appendixes, which take up most of volume 2: a bibliography of autobiographical and fictional accounts of homelessness, a filmography on homelessness, a directory of street newspapers, 23 documents related to the history of homelessness, and a "Master Bibliography." The index, more than 50 pages long, includes extensive cross-references.</p><p>There have been a variety of publications on homelessness in the last five years, but no other up-to-date publication is as comprehensive as this encyclopedia. The price tag may be too steep for some, but the set is highly recommended for libraries where homelessness is an issue, for all undergraduate collections as an awareness tool, and as a great broad introduction to the issues of homelessness in today's societies. <i>Diana Shonrock</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

That&#x2019;s honesty. That&#x2019;s it. You are an organism. You are in competition with death.<br><br>&#x2014;Laird Hamilton<br><br>Death colors, shapes, illuminates, consumes, elevates, and inspires us.<br><br>Its turbulence; its randomness; the impenetrable veil around it; and its inevitable occurrence&#x2014;these are what shape our material and spiritual nature. Who we are. What we are. Why we are.<br><br>But in many advanced Western cultures, we are losing our connection with death. We&#x2019;re pushing it away as an unwanted side effect of being human. A flaw in the organism. But in losing our connection to death, we lose something vital in life.<br><br>Here, Laird explores his relationship with death and with fear&#x2014;and how the presence of death throughout his life has moved him, marked him, shaped his nature, and influenced how he chooses to live every moment. And he explores how fear can be a force for good in our lives, fuel for our fire&#x2014;but only if we first seek to understand it, and then learn how to manage it.<br><br>LAIRD<br><br>You know, the ocean came and took people off the beach and you never saw them again. They weren&#x2019;t people that I was personally connected to, but I was exposed to people drowning and people getting brought up right in front of my house&#x2014;bodies getting pulled in.<br><br>Death was a part of everyday life. It casts a shadow. Leaves its mark.<br><br>I had a friend&#x2014;a guy who moved in next door to us&#x2014;who I used to surf with quite a bit. I went to get him one morning and he was laying on the floor of his house, dead. He didn&#x2019;t come out as he always did, so I went in to look for him and I found him lying there.<br><br>I&#x2019;ve been exposed to a fair amount of death from a young age. Situations where I would come across people being dead, either through drowning or natural causes. Those situations were probably more than a normal boy might experience.<br><br>The majority of the death I was exposed to was ocean-related. People just getting sucked away and never being seen again; or floating in five days later. You get an instinct for it.<br><br>I remember once being down at the beach and just feeling that something wasn&#x2019;t right. Wasn&#x2019;t good. You get to know the water. To sense things. So there I am, pretty young, telling a guy not to go in the water&#x2014;and the guy telling me to &#x201c;piss off.&#x201d; He then goes in the water, and the guy drowns&#x2014;and then his son drowns.<br><br>I think that situation affected me deeply. It changed me. It made me a lot more aggressive. Once I could tell that someone shouldn&#x2019;t be going in the water; that they didn&#x2019;t have the experience, the knowledge, to be there; I&#x2019;d walk up and tell them.<br><br>I could be ten years old and go in there and swim all day, and I&#x2019;d see adults go in there and drown. So at a certain point I really starting getting in people&#x2019;s faces, and telling them that they really shouldn&#x2019;t be going out there. It didn&#x2019;t matter to me that I was just a kid.<br><br>I mean, no one likes being told what to do, right? Especially by some punky kid. They&#x2019;re kind of like, &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t tell me what to do.&#x201d;<br><br>But it&#x2019;s the sea. You have to accept it. You have got to go to it with respect in your heart.<br><br>&#x201c;Laird wasn&#x2019;t really disobedient&#x2014;he was still practicing his intelligence; he was putting other people to the test; although they thought they were testing him, he was testing everybody else.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x2014;Coppin Colburn, Hamilton family friend<br><br>Surfing was dangerous even when I was small. I lived at the Pipeline and they were pulling guys in with skulls cracked open, faces smashed&#x2014;guys that were tough. Surfers got hurt a lot at that beach because that&#x2019;s a very dangerous beach, and then I went from that to moving to another island where a couple of the beaches that I played on were equally dangerous. One of my favorites, Lumahai, was the second deadliest beach in the state of Hawaii. It ate three or four people every year&#x2014;sometimes more. So I played and lived in places where people got smashed up a lot. Died. A lot.<br><br>A lot of people get hurt in surfing. Sometimes it&#x2019;s just minor stuff. Stitches and puncture wounds. And sometimes because of the nature of that sport, you&#x2019;d get smashed heads, broken necks&#x2014;something heavier. And people&#x2019;s skill was everything in surviving in that water. The equipment they were riding wasn&#x2019;t nearly as reliable.<br><br>But even so, there&#x2019;s a forgiveness about the ocean in one way. A lot more people should be getting a lot more hurt a lot more often than they do, given what they&#x2019;re doing. It&#x2019;s remarkable that the Pipeline doesn&#x2019;t take more lives.<br><br>So in the world I grew up in, death and your relationship with the ocean are one.<br><br>I think there&#x2019;s a through line that exists among all people who are connected to the ocean. There&#x2019;s always one or two random hot rods out there, but for most people attached to the sea, there&#x2019;s a certain respect that you have for the ocean, and a pretty conscious awareness because of the nature of the environment itself.<br><br>The environment is so powerful that you&#x2019;re going to have death on your mind somewhere. And you&#x2019;re going to believe in something greater. I don&#x2019;t think there&#x2019;s a lot of atheists in the lineup, just given the nature of the magic and the beauty and the intricacy of what the ocean is.<br><br>A friend of mine calls the ocean &#x201c;the soup of life.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s a pretty complex and very alive organism. And it doesn&#x2019;t discriminate. It will just pound you.<br><br>And in that moment&#x2014;in that turbulence, when you lose the edges of what you know in that white-water tumble dryer&#x2014;that&#x2019;s where science meets the spiritual. If you&#x2019;re underwater, you can&#x2019;t breathe. It doesn&#x2019;t matter who you are and what you can do, pretty much we&#x2019;re all the same guys sooner or later under the water. We all have the innate fear of drowning. We all have the presence to understand that there&#x2019;s no oxygen below the waterline; and there&#x2019;s big creatures that live there and heavy stuff happens.<br><br>&#x201c;Nobody knows that ocean better than Laird; ever since he was a little kid, he belonged there in the water. The ocean communicates to him. And he knew that&#x2014;something about that water that drew him to the ocean&#x2014;if he could sleep in the ocean, he would sleep in the ocean. He respected it and knew it&#x2014;and he knows the ocean can take his life at any time.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x2014;Coppin Colburn<br><br>My description of riding a wave is simple: there&#x2019;s no beginning and no end&#x2014;it&#x2019;s just a continuation. Where you start and where you left off are just phases or moments on the same line&#x2014;on the same continuum. And that&#x2019;s life, too.<br><br>Death has always been there for me, I suppose. And not always just the kind served by the sea. Not knowing my real dad&#x2014;that&#x2019;s a kind of death. Is it a physical death? No&#x2014;but there&#x2019;s grief there, for sure.<br><br>If I look back on my father&#x2019;s absence&#x2014;I think that&#x2019;s what death ultimately is&#x2014;they&#x2019;re gone&#x2014;they&#x2019;re absent. For me, I think the initial exposure to the concept of someone being dead was ultimately the fact that I didn&#x2019;t have a dad. My dad was gone, whether he was alive or not&#x2014;I didn&#x2019;t even know. He wasn&#x2019;t there&#x2014;ever&#x2014;on the phone or in a letter&#x2014;there was nothing.<br><br>I realize now that I was grieving that absence and loss. I just started from the beginning of my life with that concept of someone being gone.<br><br>That was a version of death that I was experiencing at a very young age. I think that definitely has to be the beginning of the foundation of my perspective on death.<br><br>Death comes in many forms, and some of it really gets to you. It shapes you. It opens your eyes. And you see how it makes every second of life precious.<br><br>Polynesians are not terrified or overpowered by the phenomena of the dead. Inborn talent, trained sensitivity, and education enable them to handle phenomena as naturally as they do the winds and the waves.<br><br>John P. Charlot, Polynesian Religions<br><br>My friend who I used to surf with as a kid was diagnosed with terminal cancer. They told him he had six months to live, so he just moved in where we lived and went surfing every day and he ended up living eight years longer. I spent a lot of time with him.<br><br>And he had the presence of death around him. He lived with death. I got no time, I got no time.<br><br>I think that definitely had an influence on me&#x2014;in the way I wanted to live my life. To make sure that I was always living in the present. How would we live if we knew that we were going to go tomorrow? We don&#x2019;t think about that enough now. It would be nice to cultivate that feeling more often, and really think about how you would live if you knew tomorrow was the last day.<br><br>I had a friend, Bunker. He was my buddy. He overdosed and died. I spent a lot of time with him when he was a kid. I watched him just transform from a happy person to an unhappy person. I couldn&#x2019;t help him. I was too young and he was too crazy, but I felt like somebody killed him. I feel like he got killed by people that were trying to take advantage of his wealth. That affected me a lot.<br><br>When somebody lives for the ocean, they&#x2019;re on it, in it, and then they go and get drowned. That&#x2019;s one thing. But when you have got a fatal condition, a terminal cancer or illness of some kind, and you&#x2019;re just dangling, waiting for the thing to drop, those are two different things right there. When you live under the truth of &#x201c;Hey, I have some sickness and I&#x2019;m going to die&#x2014;I&#x2019;m going to die in the next day or two or month&#x201d;&#x2014;when you have that hanging over you, that definitely influences your behavior&#x2014;versus when you&#x2019;re young and you think you&#x2019;re invincible!<br><br>Let&#x2019;s be clear here. Death is part of life. It&#x2019;s the cycle. Where I grew up it was pretty ordinary in some ways.<br><br>Death is just part of the deal.<br><br>It&#x2019;s no surprise to me that when you look at many high-performing people in any field, they will have the echo or the evidence of some high-stress point, some emotional trauma, on them; something that stressed the organism. Abandonment. Poverty. Abuse. Humiliation. Grief. Loss.<br><br>I suppose in that way death has often been a relentless stress point on me. And in a weird way perhaps it has evolved me in particular ways.<br><br>My mom&#x2019;s death had big effect on me. I&#x2019;m only just starting to realize how much.<br><br>But one thing about her preparation for death was that it didn&#x2019;t put a burden on me. I didn&#x2019;t have any potential resentments that could come from somebody you care for dying and leaving a big mess, and then you have to go clean it all up. That wasn&#x2019;t the case&#x2014;if anything, it was the opposite. You learn from that.<br><br>I was in good standing with my mom, so I was lucky. She and I had just recently reconciled our differences, so we were pretty OK. I think that helped me&#x2014;going through the mourning of it&#x2014;because we were good. There was no regret. Nothing lost to us. Regret is a killer. That stuff will tear you up.<br><br>I found equality in the sea. It was a place I could escape to. There was something there I needed. The trouble was on the land.<br><br>&#x2014;Laird Hamilton<br><br>Sure, in my need for the ocean, I may have been running away from stuff. But I was also running towards stuff.<br><br>Let&#x2019;s not forget, the sea was really exciting. Super thrilling. You would come back and feel invigorated, feeling so alive.<br><br>The sea is thorough: all-consuming&#x2014;literally. You go into it and you&#x2019;re immersed&#x2014;physically, emotionally, spiritually&#x2014;separated from any of the things that you&#x2019;re thinking about&#x2014;or that you don&#x2019;t want to think about.<br><br>My need to connect with the ocean is ever present. I naturally gravitate towards the power of it because it&#x2019;s the most honest and the most productive way to live for me.<br><br>Life is here. Death is here. They&#x2019;re both of each other&#x2014;as close to each other as the negative and the positive of a battery&#x2014;intertwined.<br><br>That&#x2019;s why you see people doing things that seem to be so dangerous&#x2014;because that&#x2019;s where you feel the most alive. Hanging in that space between life and death. Of course we&#x2019;re going to go there: that just makes complete sense to me. If you make it so nothing&#x2019;s dangerous and there is no risk&#x2014;then how does the living feel? Pretty boring. You need one to offset the other. Pleasure doesn&#x2019;t really have the power it does without pain. The nature of pleasure is directly related to the experience of pain&#x2014;that discomfort of the senses. Those things are interrelated. They need each other to exist. We need fear to exist completely; to know what calm is. What serenity is.<br><br>But let&#x2019;s be clear. Feeling fear and being scared are two very different things. Fear is about respect. Fear leads to informed action. How we manage and control fear is an elementary part of survival. Fear reminds us that we need to continuously assess risk. That&#x2019;s honesty. That&#x2019;s respect for things bigger and stronger than you.<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s always waiting. I can feel it; some days I feel for him. I used to dream that I could produce big waves for Laird&#x2014;I used to have dreams that would say, &#x2018;OK. Here&#x2019;s the deal,&#x2019; like a power; &#x2018;It&#x2019;s gonna come tomorrow and it&#x2019;s gonna be twenty feet tall.&#x2019; I used to wish that for him because sometimes it&#x2019;s a long time.<br><br>&#x201c;And he has a fear&#x2014;a fear of a flat planet. For him it&#x2019;s maybe the only time he can take all his skills and put them to the test, but also be completely consumed in it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x2014;Gabby Reece<br><br>Fear is about being on. Fear is about awareness. Where does that ability to switch &#x201c;on&#x201d; come from, to manage it? It can come from lots of places. For me there was a tipping point in my relationship with fear: the first time I can remember switching that awareness &#x201c;on.&#x201d;</p><h2>Fundamentals of Menu Planning</h2><p><i><b>Understanding the fundamentals of menu planning is essential to building a successful foodservice concept since the menu is the foundation upon which a foodservice operation builds both its reputation and profit.

Mayer was the highest-paid man in the country, and Hollywood produced 530 feature films a year. One decade and five thousand movies later, the studios were faltering. The 1940s became the decade of Hollywood's decline: anticommunist hysteria excommunicated some of its best talent, while a 1948 antitrust consent decree ended many of the business practices that had made the studio system so profitable.</p><p>In this masterful work of cultural history, the legendary Otto Friedrich tells the story of Hollywood's heyday and decline in a vivid narrative featuring an all-star cast of the actors, writers, musicians, composers, producers, directors, racketeers, labor leaders, journalists, and politicians who played major parts in the movie capital during the turbulent decade from World War II to the Korean War.</p><p>Friedrich draws on sources from celebrity biographies to trade-union history, mingling lively gossip with analysis of Hollywood's seedier business dealings and telling the stories of legendary movies such as <em>Citizen Kane</em>, <em>The Maltese Falcon</em>, <em>Double Indemnity</em>, and <em>All About Eve</em>.</p><p>A classic portrait of a special place in a special time, City of Nets gives us a singular behind-the-scenes glimpse into a bygone era that still captivates our imaginations.</p></p><p>The late Otto Friedrich enlivened the pages of many newspapers and magazines with his vigorous prose. His journalistic ability to convey complex material in a vivid, accessible manner is evident in <i>City of Nets</i>, a mordant portrait of Hollywood in the 1940s. (Originally published in 1986, it's the middle volume in a trilogy of superb urban histories that also includes <i>Before the Deluge: A Portrait of Berlin in the 1920s</i> and <i>Olympia: Paris in the Age of Manet</i>.) Friedrich drew on his voluminous reading of everything from celebrity bios to trade-union history to create a unique synthesis that, for a change, depicts Tinseltown not as a dreamland floating above American reality, but as a city subject, like any other, to economic and political forces. Friedrich mingles enjoyable gossip with hardheaded analysis of Hollywood's often unsavory industrial underpinnings, including studio heads' willingness to rely on gun-wielding gangsters to solve their labor problems. There's no other movie book quite like it; Rita Hayworth's divorce proceedings against Orson Welles follow hard on the heels of a gruesomely detailed description of Bugsy Siegel's execution. The '40s were the decade of Hollywood's decline: a blacklist prompted by anticommunist hysteria shut out some of its best talent, while a 1948 antitrust consent decree ended many of the business practices that made the studio system so profitable. Friedrich's brilliantly selective use of colorful anecdotes and revealing details perfectly captures a decaying, but still glamorous, culture. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>This dazzling story of Hollywood during the 1940s is a social and cultural history of the movie capital&#39;s golden age. Its cast includes actors, writers, musicians and composers, producers and directors, racketeers and labor leaders, journalists and politicians in the turbulent decade from World War II to Korea.</p><h2>A Manual of Painting Materials and Techniques</h2><p>Provides guidance on the use of art materials such as pigments, solvents, oil paints, pastels, and varnishes</p><p></p><h2>Unlikely Partners: Chinese Reformers, Western Economists, and the Making of Global China</h2><p><p><i>Unlikely Partners</i> recounts the story of how Chinese politicians and intellectuals looked beyond their country&#x2019;s borders for economic guidance at a key crossroads in the nation&#x2019;s tumultuous twentieth century. Julian Gewirtz offers a dramatic tale of competition for influence between reformers and hardline conservatives during the Deng Xiaoping era, bringing to light China&#x2019;s productive exchanges with the West.</p><p>When Mao Zedong died in 1976, his successors seized the opportunity to reassess the wisdom of China&#x2019;s rigid commitment to Marxist doctrine. With Deng Xiaoping&#x2019;s blessing, China&#x2019;s economic gurus scoured the globe for fresh ideas that would put China on the path to domestic prosperity and ultimately global economic power. Leading foreign economists accepted invitations to visit China to share their expertise, while Chinese delegations traveled to the United States, Hungary, Great Britain, West Germany, Brazil, and other countries to examine new ideas. Chinese economists partnered with an array of brilliant thinkers, including Nobel Prize winners, World Bank officials, battle-scarred veterans of Eastern Europe&#x2019;s economic struggles, and blunt-speaking free-market fundamentalists.</p><p>Nevertheless, the push from China&#x2019;s senior leadership to implement economic reforms did not go unchallenged, nor has the Chinese government been eager to publicize its engagement with Western-style innovations. Even today, Chinese Communists decry dangerous Western influences and officially maintain that China&#x2019;s economic reinvention was the Party&#x2019;s achievement alone. <i>Unlikely Partners</i> sets forth the truer story, which has continuing relevance for China&#x2019;s complex and far-reaching relationship with the West.</p></p><p>Julian Gewirtz, a 2013 graduate of Harvard College, is a Doctoral Candidate at the University of Oxford and a Rhodes Scholar.&#x201c;Shedding light on how China achieved radical economic change in less than two decades, [Gewirtz&#x2019;s] book is instructive for anyone who wants to know how other countries can emerge from poverty and place themselves on the path to development...At a time when the Chinese model again seems to be creaking, President Xi Jinping would be wise to heed the message of Gewirtz&#x2019;s book: that China does best when it is open to foreign ideas.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Howard French</b><b>, </b><b><i>Wall Street Journal</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;A remarkable book, written with poise and confidence, that shows how closely Chinese reform was tied to ideas from the capitalist and socialist blocs during the Cold War, and illuminates the beginnings of an economic idea that would transform China and change the world.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Rana Mitter</b><b>, </b><b><i>Project Syndicate</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;I loved this book. It is a tour de force on China, the theory of policy advising, and the history of economic thought, all rolled into one.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Tyler Cowen</b><b>, </b><b><i>Marginal Revolution</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;It vividly brings to life China&#x2019;s economic debates from Mao&#x2019;s death in 1976 until 1993, by which time the country&#x2019;s direction was clearer... The claim is not that Westerners were responsible for China&#x2019;s development. A large constellation of Chinese reformers deserves the credit for that. Indeed, one of the book&#x2019;s virtues is that it puts the spotlight on Zhao Ziyang, the Communist Party chief who wound up under house arrest after the 1989 Tiananmen protests. Zhao has been written out of official histories, but his consistent support for bold thinking was critical to China&#x2019;s success... Gewirtz&#x2019;s book does not attempt to provide a definitive account of China&#x2019;s economic rise... But it is still a gripping read, highlighting what was little short of a revolution in China&#x2019;s economic thought.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>The Economist</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;A fluent account of the partnership between Chinese and foreign experts in the &#x2018;golden age&#x2019; of the 1980s that helped set the stage for the country&#x2019;s ascent as a global power...What this book lays out is a fascinating example of the power of international collaboration.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Jonathan Fenby</b><b>, </b><b><i>Financial Times</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Provides a gracefully written narrative of the unusual experiments with mixing economic forms that facilitated China&#x2019;s economic boom...Nicely crafted and carefully argued.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Jeffrey Wasserstrom</b><b>, </b><b><i>Los Angeles Review of Books blog</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Gewirtz&#x2019;s account of China&#x2019;s transition from Marxist central planning to &#x2018;socialist market&#x2019; economics is masterful: detailed, balanced, and illuminating...This is a revelatory account of China&#x2019;s economic evolution, its debt to Western economic thought, and its love-hate relationship with capitalism.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Publishers Weekly (starred review)</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Gewirtz&#x2019;s book reminds us that in their early days, at any rate, China&#x2019;s economic reforms may have owed more to Western economists and economic theory than present-day Chinese leaders would be inclined to acknowledge.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Peter Harris</b><b>, </b><b><i>New Zealand International Review</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;A great book and a delight to read.

From its appearance as a &#x201c;fashionable dissipation&#x201d; centered on the immigrant and working-class districts of 1880s New York through its spread to Chicago and into the 1930s nightspots frequented by lesbians and gay men, <i>Slumming</i> charts the development of this popular pastime, demonstrating how its moralizing origins were soon outstripped by the artistic, racial, and sexual adventuring that typified Jazz-Age America. Vividly recreating the allure of storied neighborhoods such as Greenwich Village and Bronzeville, with their bohemian tearooms, rent parties, and &#x201c;black and tan&#x201d; cabarets, Heap plumbs the complicated mix of curiosity and desire that drew respectable white urbanites to venture into previously off-limits locales. And while he doesn&#x2019;t ignore the role of exploitation and voyeurism in slumming&#x2014;or the resistance it often provoked&#x2014;he argues that the relatively uninhibited mingling it promoted across bounds of race and class helped to dramatically recast the racial and sexual landscape of burgeoning U.S. cities.</p> <p> </p> <p>Packed with stories of late-night dance, drink, and sexual exploration&#x2014;and shot through with a deep understanding of cities and the habits of urban life&#x2014;<i>Slumming</i> revives an era that is long gone, but whose effects are still felt powerfully today.</p> <p></p></p><p><p><b>Chad Heap</b> is associate professor of American studies at the George Washington University.</p>Heap&#x2019;s enthralling history defines &#x201c;slumming&#x201d; broadly, to encompass the activities of Victorian social reformers, who enjoyed dropping in on immigrant households, and the &#x201c;Negro vogue&#x201d; and &#x201c;pansy and lesbian craze&#x201d; of the nineteen-thirties. He concentrates on Chicago and New York, where anti-vice committees documented salaciousness from the red-light districts of the Lower East Side to the &#x201c;bohemian thrill-age&#x201d; of the Village and the cross-dressing &#x201c;sex morons&#x201d; farther north. His evidence suggests that immigrants, bohemians, blacks, and gays provided the city&#x2019;s best live entertainment; according to Heap, they also provided a backdrop of degradation against which whiteness and heterosexuality defined themselves. The racial, social, and sexual implications of each slumming fad, &#x201c;from the best intentioned to the most horrifyingly exploitative,&#x201d; are assiduously parsed, perhaps to mitigate the inherent titillation of the material. <br>Copyright ï¿½2008<i> Click here to subscribe to The New Yorker</i></p><h2>What is Psychology?: Foundations, Applications, and Integration</h2><p>WHAT IS PSYCHOLOGY?

Volume I traces the development of political theory "from the beginning" in ancient Greece through the Reformation. Main subjects examined include the Classical political theory of the Greek polis, the Hellenistic period, the rise of Christian political theory, political theory of the middle ages, and the Reformation. Major figures examined include Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, St. Augustine, St. Thomas, Marsilius of Padua, and Martin Luther. Throughout, the great theorists are closely examined in their historical contexts, with extensive quotations allowing them to speak for themselves. Central concepts employed in their works are carefully examined, with special attention to how these fit together to form coherent theories. The works of the great theorists are further considered in regard to how they bear on issues of contemporary concern, such as constitutionalism, natural law, and resistance to unjust authority. The result is not only an exploration of the great works of political theory but a demonstration of their continuing relevance.<br></p><p><br>George Klosko works in both normative political theory and the history of political thought. His books include <em>Political Obligations</em> (Oxford, 2005) the Second Edition of <em>The Development of Plato's Political Theory</em> (Oxford, 2006). <em>The Oxford Handbook of the History of Political Philosophy</em> (2011), which he edited. He is Henry L. and Grace Doherty Professor of Politics at the University of Virginia. <br>Klosko&#39;s introduction will serve the purposes of most undergraduate courses in the history of political theory very well, and especially those that wishes to structure their reading lists around the texts of Plato. ... [I]t will help students access these texts and see their relevance for the predicaments faced by each and every democratic citizen. * Mark Fisher, LSE Review of Books *</p>
